Do you think it is important for people to be knowledgeable about the history of that location?
"Well, um, there were games like tag, hopscotch, and Blind Man's Bluff, along with other similar games."
"We were like, hey, give this slice to that African American gentleman over there. And then when I quit, nobody realized that I was African American."
"Because this place was once home to people aged fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-one. When we initially acquired this station, we operated all of them."
"Yeah, because at that time, I couldn't sleep at night. You see, nobody told me that the telephone rang around two-thirty. This is because my sister had moved from Lone Pine and came to stay with me because her children were in trouble, you know."
"Christmas? Everyone is joyful and celebrating. They drink. You understand what I'm saying. They also go out to different places and have a great time. Then they return, you know. They continue to celebrate even more."

"Date night went really well, like a perfect ten."
"Yes, Have you ever played the game Engine, Engine?"

It was something that I definitely had to do.
There is nothing you can do to change it.
Hmm. Was all of this in the same year?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was thinking about something."
"Um, well the boys who lived down the street, I was the only girl in my neighborhood, so we used to play Cowboys and Indians. I always played the role of the Indian princess, and I was always rescued by the cowboy or someone else. [laughter]"
"I wasn't able to access the computer or anything, and I was thinking, well it doesn't matter to me. I have five computers at home. I don't feel the need to use your computer. And it turned into a back and forth argument. And as a result, I got suspended from school. Well, they actually expelled me from school, so I ended up going to RD-SCHOOL-2."
"Even if she didn't raise her voice at you, you know, why did she shout? Or speak loudly often?"
"Yeah, that's the thing though. In my junior year, I started playing sports. I was also involved in theater."
"? - Okay, we're on Fourth Street- right next to the intersection of Fourth Street and Avenue C. , Right next to the grocery store that we currently have."

"But, similar to comic books, we really enjoy both science fiction and technology. Um. Where I chose to pursue humanities, he chose to pursue sciences, so he has a passion for computers. Uh, we both have an affinity for comic books, but I prefer DC while he prefers Marvel."
"Do you think that, um, what is your favorite? So you say you have been to the restaurants. So we know about Ben's. What is your favorite restaurant in DC?"
I'm not going to deny my connection to the streets. I originated from the streets. I originated from the impoverished area. That's the reality. That's a part of our culture.
"I'm going to do a side note. So when Rhonice and Veronica went into the neighborhood to find her phone,"
"Oh, I understand. There is a distinction between a brick mason and a brick layer. I was unaware of that."
I understand. Were you part of a union or anything?
"Yes, that's correct. And is that how you currently feel?"
"So, it's been a challenging season for you this year."
I want to hang out with someone other than you.
What is your occupation? Do you work with young children?
What are some of the subjects you have taken currently?
"Wow. Was it girls, boys, or was it a mix?"
No one informed me about that. We are from Southeast.
They have met everyone from Washington DC and Northern Virginia.
"Were you born and raised in Washington, D. C. ?"
I have been dating RD-NAME-2 since I first came here.
You said not to show off unless someone comes in.
"The first one ended, you know, it didn't work correctly."
Okay. I will keep an eye out for your name.
"Um, do you have any idea what you're going to aim for when you get out of school? What do you want to become or what would you like to become?"
I don't have much information. I had information about the number of times our area had been flooded before the flood.
"Now I'm going to have to pay attention. When I go back over there, I'm going to pay attention to it."
"I think, well, one person closes their eyes while everybody else hides, and then that person goes and looks for them."
"Tarzan was in the tree and he fell out. What color was his blood? And they would say a color, like red. Pause 0. 77. R - E - D spells the word red. Lastly, you know, the one who is ""it. """
"Now, let's revisit the topic of being teased because I found it quite endearing the way you were talking about it. I'm curious, why were you teased? Or how did it make you feel when you were teased? Specifically, what did you write about?"
"And regarding my parents passing away, or something happening to them or something like that, since this summer and the riots and everything, and people getting hurt, I've been extremely afraid of that."
"And, they, um, they construct a, um, house made of cardboard, and you walk through it and converse and all that stuff."
". - Over there. And after we got to a certain grade, then we had to walk over town to Pattillo School."
She - her oldest daughter went to school. She was going to school. She is now out for the summer in Boston.
"""Um, there was this person who used to take classes with me. And, well, he is failing in math, you know. """
"I told her that if that's what she wants to do, she should sign it right here, and she signed it there."
"I don't know, this world is insane. I mean, I don't know. I just think you have to have faith in God."
"Yeah, I used to come to Princeville sometimes. There are clubs or places around here like that, but just a little bit."
"Not only the song, but let me explain go go music to you. Is it different from hip hop? Just describe it."
"I got a tattoo to remember that I was unable to say ""rest in peace"" because she is still alive. So, yeah."
"I was standing in someone's, uh, a woman's doorway, you know?"
"Okay. , It's very clear. , It makes sense to me."
"The man is around, I would say, maybe in his thirties."
"Wow, I must have been around thirteen or fourteen years old."
"Did you all just find out, probably not too long ago?"
"No, I understand, Play wasn't interested in that lifestyle at all."
"Um, the, uh, RD-NAME-2, I am five years older than him."
I have a lot of things scattered all over the place.
Do you not feel safe even when you are at home?
"I understand completely. You have to show love like that, mm-mm."
It was - I was very young when I started singing.
"This is like, the whole year. So you have both seasons."
What do you want to do after you graduate from school?
"Okay, do you- is it a house that your family owns?"
Even though there are four kids? No? You're over the limit.
"I gave some to my mother and spent it, I guess."
"That's good. That's what you have, you know, that support system."
"""And I would be like, I'm not going to do it anymore, Dad. "" And he would be like, ""Okay. "" And my mom would be like, ""Oh, you're going to punish me. You can't talk on the phone. You can't look at TV. """
"And he left all of us, except for Mr. RD-NAME-1. He came to the house and mentioned that nobody was here. No neighbors came to the house and told us to leave or anything."
"Yeah, I took it. And I ran it just like they wanted to run it. But the guy, the way he was doing it, now he was, uh, up to date man because he grew up - he was born and raised on his daddy's farm."
"When someone's mother is sick, we gather on the front porch. And if someone starts shouting and causing a commotion, we advise them not to shout and create a scene. But they continue to shout. As a result, we become angry and engage in a fight."
"And, like, I often engage in activities such as playing, speaking, or sometimes even throwing objects around the room. It's similar to that."
He is a bit skinny. He has a light brown complexion. He has an earring. He lives in Simp and knows my father. He has a temporary fade haircut. He is someone I will always cherish.
"Man, that's likely the reason why everyone began relocating to Atlanta. It's the best place to go and escape from any kind of trouble."
"Hmm, I don't believe it, but I'm going to let it go."
She is employed by the Boys and Girls Club of greater Washington.
And they will come over here and assist us in that manner.
"I believe we should go out for a drink, [RD-NAME-2]. Goodness gracious."
"Hey, who are you, /RD-NAME-2/? Can you tell me about yourself, /RD-NAME-2/?"
And RD-NAME-1 used to hang out near E Street and play basketball.
"Um, our schedule is that we stay in class for eighty-five minutes."
Do you remember the dog you had a few years ago? [laughing]
"And just to let you know, there were quite a few people."
"Oh, you're supposed to hop, skip, like this, you know, and uh-"
Yeah. He has a sharp face. You would probably think so. [laughter]
"It doesn't have to be uncomfortable. Um, unless you make it uncomfortable."
"Hmm, is that where you typically spend the majority of your summers?"
"Um, but- I mean, but you all have technology now, so phones."
"Do you live on the same street as me? Hey, do you spend time with a group of individuals who have special needs or are differently abled? Are there a group of you who are close friends?"
"Uh, let's see. Do you play games with both girls and boys? I mean, you know, do you play with both girls and boys together?"
". - or, on the weekends. Right? And then on family days, they go to either their mother's or father's house who don't live here."
Yes. What do you do? What activities do you enjoy when you are alone? What do you like to do when you are by yourself?
Do you think people from Rochester have a distinct accent? Or do certain individuals who reside here sound more like they're from Rochester than others?
"Oh, well, as you mentioned, you know, um, like you said, the word ""bumping. "" That was an old slang term from the past, like when someone would say, ""Man, that stuff is bumping. "" Bumping means good."
"And did you all live? As far as you can remember or what you've been told, did you all live with your grandmother for a while?"
That is amazing. I really want to either go to White Waters or-
"Uh, I haven't really considered it. It's too far in the future. [laughs]"
There is a lot of depth when you look into a person's eyes.
"Are you okay? Um, how long do you think it's going to take?"
We can resolve this issue because we prefer to dip rather than pour.
People are asking as if we haven't seen RD-NAME-3 in a few days.
"You know what I'm saying, those who live in these tenement houses, who"
"Physically, it has changed. But, do you- Like, what changes do you see?"
I have one child. I have never had one who was born dead.
I found the story to be interesting because I was unaware of it.
"It was him and the Boy- Boy Wonder, they are always fighting criminals."
"Do you attempt to not necessarily correct them, but do you try to provide them with a different perspective or do you just go along with it?"
"But I think it's important to understand that just because that's where you were, it doesn't mean that's where you are or where you have to remain."
I will email it to you. I want you to prepare for it. We are going to meet tomorrow. I will be in the office all day.
"Okay, so let me- Since you mentioned high school, we're going to go back to childhood, but I want to talk about high school for a minute."
"We came for, where they call, and things like that, you know, like you, um, you go in on the subject, like in here today, you see?"
"What do you think was the issue you wanted to discuss? I apologize for repeatedly referring to it, but what is your opinion on that particular matter?"
"Do you feel like, as someone who is from here, that you really participate in those activities, or do you feel like those activities are more for tourists?"
"Um, Shakur, you know what I'm saying, people immediately associate it with Tupac, but"
"Oh, I don't know how you. it depends upon the personality of the person."
"What is it like to have to start over? I mean, and it wasn't."
"I know my mother's father is from Washington, D. C. I do know that."
"Because, you know, most people say you have to spread it evenly on everything."
"It's kind of your fault because of that one day. No, I'm just kidding."
Mm. When did you realize that you had a strong interest in creating music?
"Actually, April sixth will be a whole year since I obtained my driver's license."
"And uh, so he said, I'm not going to stay, I'm going back home."
"I started getting into cheerleading. Um, so tell me, okay so you played sports, so let's talk about school for a minute then we're gonna talk more about sports."
"I understand that for them, it may be considered the same. However, it's not the same for me because many people didn't move back into their homes after the flood."
I didn't know back then. *laughs* So. I don't know what else to tell you.
"And I'm a generous person, and it's like I would give somebody everything I have."
"Yes, I understand. You don't have to transport it or load it onto a truck."
And my brother had been in Florida. My youngest brother is over there with her.
"Catch me! And then, I just fell or crashed all over the place, woke up."
"And so, all of us ran up. My family went over to Mr. [RD-NAME-1]'s house."
"You have friends who are different. Alright. So, let's discuss your friends from school first."
Do you have a particular type of car that you would really like to have?
Can you share your experiences of attending the Boys and Girls Club during your childhood?
"And they came in aggressively too, to get the drug dealers. Right? Well, we- well."
"I have never put myself into anything like this before. I was, I'm crazy. Why did I say cheering? I think it's because of the poetry club and cheering, because that's when I actually started getting into sports and stuff. And I was like, oh, I can do a split, or I could tumble, I could do this flip. I was excited."
"That's cool. Very good. Okay, have you ever been in a situation where you thought, oh man, this is it. I'm going to die now. Like a car crash or something?"
"? - And then my last kind of fun question just because you kept talking about the Redskins, and then I'll just have you, um, do a couple things for me."
"Does that mean, was that one of the reasons you want to go into Social Services?"
"I think that is going to happen. Yeah, I've heard a lot of talk about that."
"Hmm? Did you say things like ""eenie meenie miney moe"" or something similar? You never did?"
"We have science and sometimes crafts, and then we have lunch and then we have sports."
"I understand. , Do you need to be a Quaker or anything like that to attend?"
"But he goes over, reaches out, touches you and leaves. Right there in the middle of the block is where the church is located. It's a nice little church in the basement. Yeah, I would get free work and have plenty of girls and everything, man. But uh. [laughter]"
"I enjoy it, I enjoy it. That's good. Especially after dealing with the situation involving RD-NAME-1, you needed to take a moment. Yeah, I appreciate that. I appreciate RD-NAME-2 for being persistent though."
"I have a lot of money, Mo. Money is what I mean. You know what I'm saying."
"What has happened? Well, um, I don't know. I suppose whatever is going to happen will happen."
"Um, she didn't have a job when I was growing up. She just took care of me."
"Um, okay so we were just talking about Seat Pleasant so we're going to go back again."
"We had to go to Tarboro, all the way around Lawrence's. Have you heard of Lawrence's area?"
And how did that- I mean how did the helicopters find you? Did they just see people?
Would you be open to allowing that land to be developed into condos that we could purchase?
"Because my parents lived in Washington DC, but I actually lived with my cousins, I never really lived with my mother. You know what I'm saying? I grew up as a child who moved around a lot. My mother couldn't take care of me, so my cousins and other family members did. I bounced around from one cousin to another cousin, and even stayed with an aunt at times."
"""Trailer back over there and about, I don't know what, two or three o'clock in the morning. """
I mean now. Because there's a lot of other craziness they can't even walk down the street. People-
I think there are two of them that I didn't write. Two people in the group wrote them.
". - Uh, not be so selfish. And actually participate and lend themselves to making a condition different."
"I was like, ever since then, I was like, alright cool. Well, what you have to say is what you have to say. But I don't necessarily have to accept or acknowledge that in what I have."
"Well, when you graduate from high school, you have the opportunity to pursue a different career path instead of working as a maid, which can offer higher income. Hmm? Don't you want to earn more money? Hmm?"
"And at this point, you understand. This is about survival. Like, you need to make it out alive, otherwise your mom is going to be very angry with you. (laughing) But like, no, but like, it's like, yeah it's- that aspect of it, I don't think will ever really change. Um, because, again, like, the stereotypes."
"Well, it's just that there is this overweight girl in my group, and they say she's the leader because, I guess, she stands out due to her size. But in reality, she's not actually the leader. However, when we go places, people assume she's the leader because we all leave when she does. But she's actually not."
"Well, we discuss business and, you know, the neighborhood and how, um, well, what we believe will happen in the neighborhood. I've noticed that, you know, the neighborhood is slowly becoming more diverse, you know, [you see? ]."
". ""And these people are top tier like, name me five people that's better than 'em, like. "" (laughing)"
"Yeah. So, on that specific day, he invited me up there and had my paper and other things organized."
"I've never been, you have a good gift of talking persuasively, you know. I can, know a few things."
My dad is the type of person who always has to be doing something. He can't just sit still.
"No, we had a parakeet at one time that I used to like. He died, though. He got old."
"Well, the exterior looks the same, but the interior is completely different. They renovated it, and then, it's unbelievable."
"I don't have any symptoms. I don't have any pain. I don't have any loss of appetite or weight. I haven't lost anything. He had a blood clot in his foot which caused it to swell up, and that's what prompted them to investigate further. After that, he began passing blood in his stool, which also caught their attention. They examined his colon and found it to be clean. Then they proceeded to investigate a bit more."
"If I wanted to get a different campus experience, I could go right across the street to Central where many people from DC ended up going. Then there's Wright State, just up the street. If I wanted to go to a more prestigious school, I could go to Ohio State and see what it's like. I enjoyed my school."
"I said, listen. I said, I don't earn a lot of money. I want to pay as little as possible."
"Yeah, there's something over there. I believe it's like a small squirrel or something, just moving around in the bushes."
"The work, and I found out there wasn't any advancement for me, you know? I just stayed in one grade."
"Well, do you ever eat anything special? Do you have special dinners or anything? What do you have for dinner?"
"People don't think that you learn - you learn how to manage a budget, right? You have your floor funds?"
"My aunt, it was just a normal day. I was going around the house, you know, picking up little broken bottles and stuff like that, and throwing them on the trash pile. My aunt told me to just leave it alone."
"I can be a bit clumsy at times. So someone gave me a pair of shoes, and they had a heel on them. The heel was probably less than one inch, you know. It was just a small shoe like that. [laughs]"
"So, then we placed the bicycle on the ground. Am I walking too quickly? I mean, am I speaking too quickly?"
"Because, um, they have a lot of expensive shops and a lot of expensive buildings and they are doing very well."
Mm. And then do you think that- So let's go back. You said you want to get some money for college.
"I mean, that tree is large, and it, got light- I mean, it has bulbs on it that are that big!"
"""Like, look, I just need to get some things off my chest. And that doesn't mean you're crazy or anything. """
"and that's what I want to hear from the people. How do they feel about your community, what are the things"
"And that's how, that's how they found. They said, ""I heard you have a good reputation, 'cause your name is. """
"Which guys are here? Are they all white? Oh, all of them. My bosses. Before I even quit, I would move to different sections. There was a man running behind me, acting like I was. My mother used to work for his father."
"- because all of my friends, I wanted to go to the school where all my friends were going. So junior high."
"Okay, well, forget about it then. Um, so when you mention that people dress differently, speak differently, and have a different mindset."
"I was around twelve years old, but I was out, you know, I always told people the truth. It was just like,"
"What is your opinion? So, you have. okay, so all of you gather and have a conversation. Where does your grandmother reside?"
"That was just them. It would be no kids in the house. We would be like, what is all that noise downstairs?"
"That was a lot. That was a lot, so let's go back. Let's go back for one more second because that was. (laughing)"
"The first time I took the train was with my mom, and my uncle threw a party for my little cousin at Chuck-E-Cheese."
"Well, you see, East Tarboro didn't experience any flooding. The flooding was limited to Princeville, and we had to use a small paddle boat."
". - (laughter) Well, you know, no, you can do that. I mean, like, why is it important to you, what do you think-"
"<laughter> So that was your experience, huh? Sometimes people say, well, there's no sense in worrying about anything because whatever is going to happen is going to happen, and you can't change it. What do you think about that? Do you agree with it or do you think we should"
". - The touristy stuff. And if you didn't live here, you would be- But you know what, we need to take ad- we ne-"
"She used to say, always say, ""Why are you asking me all these questions, boy? Nobody else in here is asking any questions. "" You."
"If that's what you want to do. And she said that's what she wants to do, so I went outside and talked to my lawyer."
"Oh lord, I'm going to die, whispered. All these wonderful educators that were in your life, when you were in the RD-SCHOOL-3 city school system."
Because there are even people in Princeville who don't really understand what it means to be a resident of Princeville. They are just there because.
"Like, in DC we create our own accent. We say things like ""dang"" or ""or"" or ""with"" or, um, I wanna say we create our own words."
"Now you mentioned about cutting up animals and things, don't you think you would have to do more of that if you're going to be a doctor?"
"Yeah, and that's. I think it was the first one. that I had seen, because. that was when. I guess he just got thrown from the car."
"I want to ask you this because people say that if you're in DC, do you consider people in the DMV area as part of DC or-"
"Woo woo! I'm glad I'm back, baby. Even though I had fun, but you know I had to get home, baby. That's how it makes you feel, man."
"I put it on my iTunes. I enjoy listening to T. I. , but I don't listen to him every day. I listen to an artist named Black."
"Well, that's how I feel as well. Because whatever is going to happen, will happen. That's what they say, right? If it's going to happen, it will happen."
"It was good. It's good. I'm about to ask for a raise. They just come randomly all the time. <laugh> It's perfect. Paid vacation, you know what I mean."
"Okay. We didn't go to church. They shouldn't have gotten married in the first place. Um, and my grandfather was a Mason. And, of course, you know, that is-"
"And it made me feel safer. And more relaxed. Even though there's a lot of chaos happening, when I was there, I thought to myself, ""Oh, this is pleasant. """
"People and things of that nature. You know, it was not the same. Going to school, you knew you had to go. I think it took me around thirty minutes."
"So, it's not enjoyable. However, if you can distance yourself from all of that and simply - like I discovered the art to concentrate on. That aspect of it is enjoyable."
"But it's something that I thought about using to my advantage. I may find a way to utilize it, but I just really want to be happy. I'm done with things like"
But he was supposed to be a genuine cowboy. And my other favorite was Johnny Mack Brown. And my special favorite was Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. Have you ever heard of them?
"I believe God has truly blessed me because I genuinely love everyone. I assist anyone I can, and if someone asks me with faith if I can help, I will definitely do it."
"Mm-hm. I love all of them. I say I don't see any harm, but I don't judge anyone. Because they say to love your enemies the same way you love your friends, so love everybody."
"You know, if I might- You know, I might not know a lot of things that they might know. I just might be scared that they ask the question, so I just basically sit back."
"You are expected to run a catering company in that manner. And so when caterers arrive, and it's just one person, one chef, and like, three people, it's like, is this all you have? Okay."
"Okay. Okay. Okay, so we're going to end the conversation. But I have one more request for you. I apologize for the interruption. Whispered, we began discussing someone special to us. We got sidetracked with, um,"
"Oh, I experienced a stroke a few years ago. I had a stroke - I had a stroke. I lost all sensation on my right side - my right side. My right side was completely paralyzed."
"Um, so, yeah. Um, what was I going to say? Yeah, people from Rochester do have an accent and I have tried so hard not to sound like that. Do I sound like that to you?"
"We lived in my grandmother's house. And we were in the room adjacent to my grandmother's. And then my uncles lived on the third floor with their children primarily. Um, and then throughout the years, we would switch places, coming in and out. Um, and when we lived in the high rise, we lived with my mother's side of the family. My cousin /RD-NAME-1/, and I think my cousin /RD-NAME-2/ may have lived there at one point in time. Um, and then we lived with others, I want to say until two thousand and- literally, until /RD-NAME-2/ was born, so until two thousand and- early two thousand, two thousand one"
"Oh, okay. Good. I'm glad as long as you know that they're not going to, uh, that you're not going to get your money right at the beginning. Um, where was your father born? Do you know?"
"Mm. Piece of advice. Mm. A piece of advice I would give to people would be Proverbs chapter three, verses five and six. So, Proverbs chapter three, verse five and six says, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Don't rely on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your path straight. "" I just think that's one of the most valuable pieces of advice you could give anybody."
"And then, I would have known maybe if /RD-NAME-3/ could have gotten a higher score on her SAT if I didn't know I shouldn't answer all of the questions on the SAT. I answered all of the questions. I still got a good score. I got a uh- I got a fourteen fifty. And that's basically what an average score is, with people not checking all the bubbles. So I probably could have gotten way higher."
"Yeah, probably about a month later. When I began to really know people, like when I started to get to know people on a deeper level. That's when I started noticing people on the bus and the train."
"It was great. And there was a meeting, I said, oh. , Really? They're telling people to do this slave work? , I'm coming. I'm on my way. , What date? Perfect. , I brought six female friends. My female friends that I grew up with. , I haven't seen them in years. , I just- I got, said, listen, hey. Have you heard about this community service thing? , Wow. We should go to this meeting."
"Um, so, can you please share with me your experiences of growing up in Atlanta? Or could you tell me why your family decided to move to Atlanta? I would like to know more about your childhood in Atlanta."
"I mean, they are extremely selfish. All they want to do is go to work, hang out at the bars, and come home. Or go out for dinner. They don't cook. They prefer going to the bars after work."
"Um, I mean it's different things. I mean it depends on what type of all white party you go to. You go to an American all white party, it might be a different type of music. People might act different."
". - because you have to be a tourist, but then this guy is taking you into his house with his family, his neighborhood. How did that feel? And what do you feel? Like what did you get from that experience?"
"And uh, we used to, We skipped school that day, my brother and I and, a few other kids. And we used to walk across P Street, well P Street- I mean, the creek was much wider than it is now, you know?"
"And I think that's optimistic. I don't think it's like, oh my god I have nothing without you. Like, don't leave me. Like no, if you want to leave, think about what you're walking out on, I hope it makes you feel regretful later."
"RD-NAME-2, I heard you were not doing well in school today. You know, come here, let me talk to you. And we had to listen. It wasn't a ""you can't talk to me"" kind of thing. You're not my mother, and all this and that movement."
"Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-hm. That's what I mean, [person's name], they don't do that. We went to the park, our parents took us to the park. We jumped double dutch, you know we did a lot. We played hopscotch, you know, played tag. But that's not the games that the kids today want to play. They want to play grown-up games. They want to play like, oh, you know, someone has a baby, maybe I should have one too, but you know it's not that easy. You know, children are very expensive. You just can't go out here."
"- and play outside, past dark. Never had to worry about anything. We would roam Alexandria, we would walk from - we would walk all the way down to Del Ray, which is all the way down the other side. So we would just be out, um, walking around through Alexandria. So- um,"
"Yeah. She moved out of my grandma's house at the age of fourteen, got pregnant with me at sixteen. So it was hard. She had a difficult time, she still does. I just want to help her now because I'm old enough to understand what's going on now. And help my little brothers, that's why I want to start this program."
"Before, I had a habit of speaking in a particular manner. Because I wanted to appear more educated, I tried to avoid sounding like my friends. Additionally, I desired to have a different appearance in person compared to how I sounded on the phone. I wanted to surprise people. Furthermore, I wanted certain aspects of myself to be true, regardless of others' opinions about my appearance."
"It was, um, yeah. All of my, um, all of my black friends were telling me that I had to go. So I went and I was like, I'm not enjoying myself. But I don't like parties or crowds, so I shouldn't have gone in the first place. But it was just, it was so, um, it was just really loud to me. And it was hot. I just wasn't having a good time."
"And so, I met [RD-NAME-2] in ninth grade. [RD-NAME-2], the one that passed away, is who I've known since pre K. And then we just met [RD-NAME-2], I want to say three years ago through my best friend [RD-NAME-2]. And so m- It was [RD-NAME-2]'s birthday- I started a mentoring program, so these are people that wanted to be mentors- So I introduced them to each other, even though I had other mentors that had applied we all went to dinner together. And then that's how we formed the Fab Five."
"The people. And we have great topics of conversation. The bus ride to go home is always great. The gym, the perfect craft. Like, one day I'm going to bring my lacrosse stick here and just practice for like, two hours straight. I haven't been able to do that yet but it's gonna happen. The resources that we have here, like the computers to get homework done is always great to do. And just like, the mentors here, like when you need to vent to somebody, they're always here to listen. That's pretty much it."
"Uh, I acknowledge that it is legal, but not le- is it legal? Like, completely legal in DC? Yeah, and it's people- it's minorities in jail for possession of marijuana, even though it is a legal thing now. Granted you can only have like point two ounces on you, but still. The fact that they're in jail because of that. They should get a pardon to get out because they were arrested before it was legal. So the fact that they're serving like, five to ten for something that's legal now, I just don't- I can't stand by. I just don't like it at all."
"It wasn't a big deal. It was just another thing, just like when you transitioned from elementary school to middle school. It's like, ""Oh no, I want to stay back. I don't want to go to middle school or junior high school. "" And once it's time to leave junior high school and go to high school, again it's like, ""Oh no, let me stay back. I can't go to high school. I know so many people or whatever. "" But then you get there and you do just fine. Then you move on to the next thing. The thing I haven't been able to achieve is that master's degree. [clap]"
"I used to hang out in DC when I was about sixteen years old. Even though I was from Maryland, it was considered cool to spend time there. It was right on the District line, and hanging out in DC was seen as cool. The kids from DC were seen as cooler. They could stay out later, dressed differently, and had more freedom compared to us. Hanging out in DC was the popular thing to do, but it was very dangerous in the 90s. So, it's a blessing that I'm still here and able to talk about it because many of my friends are not."
"Yeah, I have always been close to my grandparents, my grandmother and my grandfather. They live off Southern Avenue. That's Southeast too. They actually built a train station. When I grew up around there, I spent a lot of years at my grandmother's house because we lived with her for a couple of years right there, on Southern Avenue. And at first when I was growing up, we didn't have a train station across the street. Like now, there's a whole train system across the street, MetroGo. There's a train stop right across the street from her house that you can walk to."
"Um, I was born and raised in Rochester. Um. My mother emigrated here from Tallahassee, Florida. My father from Hazlehurst, Mississippi. Uh, he came here for Kodak, she came here for the University of Rochester. They met in church. Um. We- when I was born, we were living in Henrietta. And then by second grade, we moved to Pittsford. They're still in that same house in Pittsford. So, I did Pittsford schools from second grade on. Um, and then, went to the University of Rochester. And then after the University of Rochester ended up in Baltimore for eight years, and now I'm back."
"Um, right now I am currently attending school online to obtain my associates degree. I have been going back to school for approximately three years now. It's just that being a working adult and also being married, although not yet divorced, and having a business, it was just too overwhelming for me to juggle all of that and focus on school. Um, one thing that Boys and Girls Club taught me is that we are surpassing the work, but I just wanted to mention that."
"Is it okay? You know, you want to do this. You want to do that. You know, you have to come to an agreement. But when you're alone, you know, okay, you do what you want to do. You know, you go to this party if you want to go. You go to that party. You know, like I said, I hang out over, I stay over in Alexandria a lot."
"And in the middle of Baruch, there is actually a shelter called The Castle. They refer to it as The Castle. That was a significant part of my childhood as well because my mom would always warn me not to associate with the kids from the shelter, the Castle kids. They were heavily stigmatized. However, it turns out that I ended up marrying someone who grew up in The Castle."
"There was no reason for them to. Um, and then digging even further, I know I have attractive eyes. I know that I look like I have mixed heritage. I know this. Um, and you don't have the opportunity to meet my brothers, but we all resemble each other. You can tell we're all related, but we all have distinct appearances. I'm the one who has hazel eyes."
"We never had the opportunity to experience being cousins. Like, oh, I'm going to my cousin's house to spend the night, and my mom was really strict about us spending the night at other people's houses. She didn't allow it. Not at all. I have never spent the night at anyone's house. I'm seventeen. I have never been to a sleepover."
"And I never really participated in it. Many times, people would say, ""Oh, you're just a goody-two-shoes. "" I was actually called a goody two shoe. And I didn't mind being called a goody two shoe. I was like, ""Listen, I'm going to wait until I'm ready. "" For one thing, it was a religious thing for me."
"I think it may have been both because I'm not going to say that I was spoiled, but I was spoiled. So even when my mom tried to do that discipline thing, my grandparents kind of stepped in and were like, no. And she didn't like that, like, at the end of the day, she's still my child."
"I had a break-in at my house. And the dog was in the basement, where he got some bologna from a store on the corner. He grabbed two slices of bologna, thinking he could feed the dogs while he was there. However, the dog was very stubborn and wouldn't let anyone feed him."
"I brought it. No, okay, so it was first and second quarter. And then springtime came around and lacrosse season was coming up, and they told me that I needed a three point O to be on the team, so I was like, alright cool and now I gotta get my grades up."
"I am happy and I am fine. And then, even the bars. The new bar owners have the same idea. Well, nobody wanted to be here, and now we have these businesses, and I am like, man. You all are still disruptive, you all still don't give back to the community."
"That's sad to me. Now RD-SCHOOL-3 High School is moving. , And that saddens me as well. I'm not as excited as the other teachers and faculty members. They're all like, oh it takes-, It's three miles to walk around the school, blah blah blah. , That doesn't excite me."
"You know, I remember that. In second grade, the teacher gave me the nickname Snake because she said I was sneaky, you know. I would be sitting in one place, and when she turned around, I would be sitting somewhere else. I was like, yeah."
"And I mean, if I had this five dollars, now, if I. I mean, if I was like some people I know, every time you get money, like you've never seen money before, you go out there and spend it just like that."
"Um, then my other question for you- So we're gonna move kind of off of that. We're gonna move on from that. So tell me about- Have you- Do you travel around DC a lot or do you seem to stay in Northwest?"
"And I was happy, I was fortunate to receive both, so I'm reminding myself that I need to maintain a high GPA. I must keep my GPA up. You know, because it looks better than just having a GPA of around 2. 0."
Because it's not just about the grades. You know what I mean? It would be different if you were going into a prestigious university like Harvard. Because Harvard doesn't solely consider grades. They take into account the overall package.
"Um, all of his brothers actually. The only brother of his that does not live in Southeast DC anymore is my Uncle /RD-NAME-2/. Um, and I don't know if he told you, the oldest three have different fathers."
"? - And then I just ran. I ran and ran and ran until- it was in the morning and I was waiting for the bus. And I ran until I caught the bus. And I was like,"
"So, the professional football teams, I didn't find out about them until I was eight. And then, when I found out about them, I read a book about Kobe Bryant, and that's when I started supporting the Lakers."
"Yes, all of my friends graduated this year. And it's going to be so difficult. I think I'm still going to come down here now, of course. Definitely I will, because I'm the Youth of the Year."
"And so, we kept all the cargo over there by the post office. And I said, now we are going to go to a telephone booth and call some more people, and that's what we did."
". (Laugh) But, they went to somebody who stole something from them. That's kind of different than us being in our taxi cab, and like, oh, you all want to go see, and so on."
"Uh, but I don't know for how many years. But it used to come up here and go across the roads there, just a couple of days and then go back down, something like that."
"And the strap. You have to sew the button and you have to draw the dot like that, where the button is supposed to go, and you have to cut it and stitch it on."
"Please share your thoughts on the subject. Tell me what you think about it. Do you have a favorite song? Or perhaps, how do you recall them, like the first time you heard it?"
"Yeah, that's okay, man. And you were talking about, you know what I'm saying, you were talking about your, um, um- Like, what do you do for a living now? What do you do?"
"Um, Levi's is another restaurant that serves soul food. Um, and then of course we have the takeout places, we have our favorite Chinese takeout places. Um, that are on every corner. [laughter]"
"I mean, my friends can come to the planet. It doesn't matter. You all can come over there. You all can say ""What's up? "" to me. What's up? That's what's happening."
"I've been trying to get RD-NAME-3, whose husband is a farmer, to bring down some of her vegetables and sell them outside of University Place, but she told me no."
"Well right now I'm, um, sort of undecided, uh, whether, uh, adult responsibilities or things more suited for children, and I can't determine at the moment what I would prefer."
"Well, I did go to school. They gave me a large pickle, a sour pickle, to be specific. I took it down in there, and that was my lunch."
"My grandmother has bipolar disorder. And my uncle has schizophrenia. So, mental illness was also very intriguing to me. That's why I decided to study psychology and cognitive science."
"Um, I have to admit that I- it's still like, I sort of started that whole journey for my own personal reasons. I did it to better myself."
"So, but I'm saying, like, okay. So, do you understand what I'm saying? Okay, let me give you an example. One girl was telling me about the gangs."
"And you flee and conceal yourself, and he would have to come and locate you. Then you must return and defeat him, to the location where he departed."
"We weren't even fifteen. We were like thirteen, fourteen in there. And I had on my nice little tutu dress. I was like, cheese! Happy birthday! Good morning!"
"""Yeah, it wasn't as carefree as other people I had talked to who had graduated several years in front of me. But I did enjoy Howard, and um-"""
We um- we just- actually we found our apartment when I was getting d- after I got my hair done. I went to go get my hair done.
"I don't do anything except go to people's houses and say, ""trick or treat, "" and whatever they give me, I take it home and eat it."
"How did you. how did you. okay, so this was when you were ending up middle school actually. So Mr. [RD-NAME-2] around your eighth grade year, right?"
I have to leave here at around ten minutes to eleven. I have a doctor's appointment at eleven thirty. I need to go out to the clinic.
". - Youth, talk about those days. When you were the youth, choir director, and youth managed- whatever, I don't know what the title was but it-"
"And then when we got in the car, it was dark, so his father told us we had to go home in our underwear that night and-"
"Every week. And movies would change frequently. They didn't stay there for weeks like they do here, like they do now. They would change maybe weekly."
"Um, and then let me ask you this, do you feel like there's anything other than like, mumbo sauce and go go that make DC unique?"
"And it was just, and like, I know, I, like, I know myself for who I am. I just did not feel like doing it."
"In Jacksonville, Florida. Oh yes. There was a massage parlor. There was also a small hotel. Then we had some entertainment. A short video."
"You have to have something to live for, and if I had to endure it, I would do my best to understand, you know?"
"It's not as rough as the new go go music is and, you know, it's just kind of chill so it fits my personality."
"And it was like the first thing associated with Rochester. When I see Rochester hoodies, or hoodies with lilacs on them, I feel disgusted."
"And all the sadness that comes with that. And so, it's okay. And you may not want to do that for quite some time."
"Um, because my younger sister used to come home and tell me about the enjoyable experiences she had at the Boys and Girls Club."
"Two thousand, okay. And when did you start, because I know for a while, you didn't drive. When did you start driving again?"
"You don't remember. Wow. The Donahue Show. Anyway, he was married to Marlo Thomas, but he had a talk show similar to Oprah."
And it's not like I'm thinking that because I saw a video where this guy was talking about - I forgot his name.
"You know what I'm saying, like oh I could play a little something. Yeah man, that's- there's nothing like that in Washington DC."
"It's not part of my playlist. Like, I have very- I don't just- don't- I don't listen- I don't keep people's names."
But you're saying you enjoyed being there? You enjoyed not being around and having your own place once you finally got it?
"What I was doing? Well, I was working in the office, cleaning it up like you know, a different office like that."
"I will create an assignment for you to complete by tomorrow, so you can start preparing. That will be our first task."
"Mm, um, I suppose. Like, we go out to eat for people's birthdays, but I feel like everyone does that. (laughing) Um-"
"Yeah, I was instantly connected, so, you know, when I go up there, you know, everyone is trying to mess with me."
"Okay, let me give you a dating tip. One of the most romantic and beautiful things - And I'm not kidding you,"
"And so, um, this guy, he got really attached to him, you know, and started calling him Cool Hand Luke. Because in-"
"It talks to him and tries to figure out his problem. See if you can help him, keep him out of trouble."
"Well, some people believe that whatever will happen in life is inevitable and there's nothing we can do to change it, anyway."
"You cannot dislike white people, you cannot dislike Jewish people, you cannot dislike Hispanic people, and you cannot dislike gay people."
"In our district, I actually assisted her during her reelection campaign, and she ended up receiving eighty-two percent of the vote."
"It's very simple. They want to take advantage of it. As they should. Because after all, it's a market. So, business."
"Yeah, and I don't- I don't know. Um, I have one other cousin, /RD-NAME-3/, who looks just like me. We have"
"Well, um, I wouldn't, um, I wouldn't be hanging out on the street, and I would go back to school."
"And she said, yeah. And she said that her sister can surpass her in age and become fifteen or fourteen."
"Okay, thanks. [laughs] Were you ever in a situation where you thought you might die or you might be killed?"
"Before, the first day, that they started, I was at school and we got out of school at twelve thirty."
"That was the time when you had a tooth sticking out above your other tooth. So, how old were you?"
So how does that work? So they're cool in the Club but then they go outside and- and it's all.
"""And so the next day, I came back to school. She said, 'I'm sorry. ' And then, that's how she-"""
"But then, in addition to the Mystics, what else do you get to do? He gets to do the."
"So it's sort of like, they're really close friends, and he was actually living with us at one time."
"No, we don't have things like giant nuclear bombs dropping on top of our heads and stuff like that."
"Oh no, I follow the rules of the East Coast. Um, it seems like you're trying to trap me."
"Yeah, I understand what you're saying. And, um, did you grow up with both of your parents or-"
"Yeah. I always said, I would have liked to be in theater if I wasn't in creative writing."
"I mean, look. You said you don't believe that whatever is going to happen is going to happen."
"So, um, I thought I got that, and then I said, ""That's too long. I cut down. """
"Okay. Cool. Um, let's see. So, did anyone- yeah- I didn't ask about your siblings. So you have-"
"And I mean, and you guys were all starting over. I mean, what was that like? You know?"
You know. We would go home and everybody had a small schedule where they would do their homework.
And that's when I had to truly understand the situation. I have always desired things to be diverse.
Yes. Did you have a good relationship or do you currently have a good relationship with your family?
"RD-NAME-1, have you ever been in a situation where you believed you could be killed or face death?"
"Well, it's a bit complicated. It was satisfactory, it was somewhat satisfactory, was somewhat unsatisfactory, you know."
Does the start of semesters ever make you feel uneasy or bothered when it's a new semester?
And it was funny because the mop looked like a lady. He had it up like that.
"So, let's discuss your experience as a Resident Assistant. Is this your first year in that role?"
"Yeah, we had various individuals in the community who would organize trips and essentially everyone would participate."
"What do you mean, how did I play? I was down on my knees, in the dirt."
"Yeah, I've done that. I've done that multiple times. I enjoy setting fires. I really love bonfires."
"And so, I was like, well my hair is silly. It- like it doesn't do anything. Like,"
"But then, I'm probably going to use that DC address, so that I can get in-state tuition."
"Hey [RD-NAME-2], if you had all the money that you wanted, what would you do with it?"
"And, uh, I mean, I mean, you know, that's what you call a friend, a pal."
"I was, um, I'm- I'm what you- Fact, I was an- I'm an orphan, you know."
"In your neighborhood, the first person who needs to change is the people who live there."
"And I just want to open up a sort of, it's like a center or something."
RD-SCHOOL-2 is right in the neighborhood where I grew up in. That's off of Bruce Place.
"And she, you know, she got strict with me, telling me what I need to do."
"You don't, if you don't need a second chance, then, you know, you're just here because."
"But that's when, you know, when they started doing things like that, I was like, uh-oh."
"For one thing, I don't have money to spend on that. [laughter] You know, I could."
"My dad was born in St. Petersburg, Florida, and my mom was born in Arlington, Georgia."
"Um, so let's go back for a moment. Do you enjoy school currently? Do you like-"
"She was insistent on me attending RD-SCHOOL-2 and I thought to myself, you know what, okay."
"Yeah, I have nieces and nephews. Now my youngest sister over there, she has two boys."
"Okay, so how did you- okay so going back to- Let's go back to elementary school."
"So, how did you guys move here? Was it because your dad was in the military?"
"to uh, work, you know, in the fields and stuff. That's all I used to hear."
"RD-NAME-1, if you had it, all to do over again, what would you do differently?"
"True, true that, true that, true. There is a lot of fast-paced lifestyle happening there."
It's your last year. What- Do you like it out there or just kind of-
"Mm-mm. Until I was, what, I think he got locked up when I was eight."
Yeah. What was the ethnic composition in Baruch? It was predominantly Latino and African American.
They are racist. They are racist. I mean the older people. I used to walk.
"I enjoy the opportunity to gather and discuss it, as well as share personal experiences."
"You can't do much about it once it has happened, right? Tell me about school."
Yeah. So now do you have any other family in the area? That's still alive.
"So, I, uh, I find it really surprising to see white people in Washington, DC."
"And it was interesting, and it was fun. And that's what attracted me to it."
"I don't know, maybe there's asbestos in a school or something similar to that?"
"If I had all the money in the world, I would help poor people."
I had to go to school with it fully covered and things like that.
"And so, since a Bear is pretty large and hairy, we named him Bear."
"Yeah, I was really misbehaving, but it was more like playful mischief, not like-"
"Uh, also in the paper, they were asking people to come and provide information."
And my mom just took everything out and let everybody sleep back there. It-
"Like, the thing is, I have this skeleton in my closet. <laugh> That stuff."
"You became aware of what Princeville was, being the historical place that it was."
"And some of them have, like my little brother is my son, like that."
"Mm-hm. I can only imagine. Just even over the last three or four months,"
"And so you weren't doing your work, you were- Oh, I see what- Mm-hm."
"She said, if, when she gets out of that job, you see, she cooks."
"I said, ""How old were you then? "" Oh, this was last year, right?"
"Usually there isn't, let's say in the block like that, put it like that."
"Maybe other people enjoy it. Perhaps people find it adorable, oh it's so cute."
"Um, are you the first one in your family to graduate from high school?"
"See, and uh, that's uh-, but they-, Most everybody comes to me for advice."
"Definitely at least seven, eight times a year, I am going to visit family."
"We went to Crystal's. So, um, this is like the seventh or eighth time."
I heard about when there was a riot at HD and someone was shot.
I have made it to sixty-seven. I am trying to make it to seventy-seven.
How long are you staying? Is it a block schedule or just one hour?
"And so when she tried to discipline me, they kind of disciplined her."
"Oh, RD-SCHOOL-3 was like, have you ever seen the movie High School High?"
I was going to ask you to read this short story or passage.
You're asking if the real Jerry Lewis returned to the person who was-
How about Jerry Lewis movie? Have you seen any of one those lately?
That is the one that granted tenants the right to purchase their building.
"And let's see, somebody else, um, have you ever heard of Thomas Reeves?"
"Yeah. When I went to Saint Vincent for the first time, I participated."
"I would go back right now, tomorrow, and it would be the best."
"We used to take our kids to him, you know, for testing and"
"Even when, uh, like some of the houses, they tried to escape out."
"I imitated you, but I've always said research. And I don't know why."
And it was as if they desired a specific kind of black girl.
I love it as well. I won't leave the place for any reason.
"""Do that. Does that neighborhood have a name or is it just. """
"And so, RD-NAME-2 hasn't even seen it, so she's probably going to scream."
"Okay, what did you do when you were a child, after school ended?"
"What are you drinking? <laugh> Go ahead, you can speak. I don't mind."
"Um, and just- sorry, I got scared for a moment while looking down."
"No. That was just all over, like you could be from different places."
And it's strange because my child feels the same way about her father.
"We stayed there for two weeks, and we had a great time."
"And B-, and, and it's one of them. Another one is seventeen."
"Oh, I understand. So, did you take turns, like, in a way?"
"Because I believe it's, you know, if I could walk to it."
"And I helped raise them up, so I call myself mom. [laughter]"
"And, it really does- Mm. It really doesn't matter in high school."
So we're planning to go during the summertime when everybody is home.
"Okay. And how did Dad feel about that? He was like, hmm?"
"Yes. , Um, what was the best Christmas present you ever had?"
"Yeah, I'm the only person from this area among all of them."
"And, you know he was always doing foolish things and everything and-"
Hmm. That's a mystery. I never understand why they do that either.
"Well, um, um, well, what do you mean? What size is it?"
"<laugh> Now, what happens if he goes and doesn't say, ""may I""?"
"And after RD-SCHOOL-6, seventh grade year is when I moved to Hahira."
"Well, what do you consider, um, good and bad behavior in classrooms?"
"And, um, we actually had about forty one people living with us."
"Oh, so you all were sort of in the middle of them."
You- So you still have a lot of family living in DC.
I am going to check if I can find more individuals.
"Mm-hm, that's cool. Um, okay, great. So, I have a- like"
"After that, uh, accident, God yeah, that accident happened in Tarboro."
"Yeah, because what happens when she no longer finds it amusing?"
"He has been to, he was in France for seven years."
"I have never had my own room, never in my life."
"Um, my favorite book again, is the Series of Unfortunate Events."
It was really high. It was at least two stories tall.
"I don't know, like that's, I love- I enjoy making ribs."
That was excessive. (laughing) I'm just stating that those were the-
"He sold records. But I believe he sold something else, though."
I really enjoy the new television programs that are currently airing.
I don't understand why anyone would want to actually do that.
And it doesn't help that you have it on your phone.
Mm. Did she ever raise her voice or shout at you?
Do you remember one of those that you could tell about?
"Yes, so what do children your age typically do after school?"
"Basically, I will do whatever is going to help the kids."
"Um, okay. Have you ever lived in Washington, D. C. ?"
"Because we went out here last week, right up the hill."
"And then, I played in various locations ever since middle school."
"No. No, my mother, okay, let me tell you this story."
"Yes. Right before I came here, I was in Gainesville, Florida."
You have a lot of kids coming down from the city.
I worked for her until about two o'clock in the day.
"Do you have a boyfriend? Well, tell me about your boyfriend."
I have approximately three pairs. What are the ones you have?
Who are some of your friends that you grew up with?
Can you provide the audio transcript for me to translate?
"Y-A-I, Young Adult Institute. Have you ever heard of it?"
"""or didn't move back to Princeville because of that. """
"And it was kind of, it was crazy around here."
"That's what I mean. Okay, what do you do there?"
"Well, it is going to happen, but heaven knows when."
I'm really excited to see what you come up with.
"Do you like Johnny Gill and all that? No, you-"
"So it was interesting, but you know who they are."
"Oh, so she had to. No, it was like eighty."
"And everything, you know, like they do in the movies."
"Um, my mom runs a deli at a grocery store."
I believe that some of the Mexicans are mostly deceased.
"Um, did you play a game called Kick the Can?"
"Oh, alright. So you resided there until the flood occurred?"
"Okay, do you live in a house or an apartment?"
"Um, so in high school, did your friends attend /RD-SCHOOL-3/?"
"Yeah, I apologize. Next year, though. Next year is approaching."
"What is it about him that's, you know, sort of"
"Saved my thirst, and quenched my thirst so many times."
"Uh, alright. And, okay. And so, alright, it's quite nice."
"Was it, it was, blow out this last year, right?"
I ran in the rope and started jumping in it.

But we really got close when we started playing softball.
He is. He worked at RD-WORK-4 for a long time.
"<laugh> What is the average salary around here? Like, uh,"

"We always referred to it as High Spy, I believe."
I had a cat named Sarah Anne for seventeen years.
"And then it had little, I call them shotgun houses."
So you don't want to go too far from home?
"So, it's really just something that you want to do."
"Um, she was very strict most of the time."
"Yes, is it really bad on the back roads?"
"I can't do anything about it, right? Okay, good."
What has been your favorite memory from high school?
"Okay, so you go and cook something really good."
"You know. And uh, you can see a difference."
"Yeah, what? You don't know what street that is?"
"Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. (humming)"
"Oh, and you don't go start at one yourself?"
How much did the one on Fourth Street cost?
"You know, then there's my sister and me here."
"Yeah, she yelled at me quite a few times."
"It's um, a French boy I know named RD-NAME-2."
Always getting into trouble and breaking into people's houses.
So you were just at church and that just-
I have never owned any dogs in my lifetime.
"Except for my hair, that's probably just a curse."
We can do it right now or later. <laugh>
"So it was what, sixteen, seventeen of you guys?"
"GPA. So they're not going to say, oh well,"
You are correct. How many dogs have you owned?
Was it a male kitten or a female kitten?
"Well, if you want to go, why shouldn't you?"
"They are not actively opposing gentrification, especially on Google."
"Well, sometimes people talk about your mother and everything."
We would dress similarly and take pictures every day.
Yeah. Do you feel that there is any hope?
That's how they know that we were back there.
"Hmm, are there any white people in that club?"
Did someone dunk? Did you go to the tryouts?
I have a beautiful granddaughter and a beautiful grandson.
I believe they begin with around ten or eleven.
And we come home at it when it's over.

things like this. You got the taxi company there.
I have a younger sister and an older brother.
"Oh, so you've lived there for a long time."

"I want to say, it's been about ten years."
Is she two days early or two days late?
"Okay. Um, but you took your mom's name, /RD-NAME-1/."
"Oh, so you weren't even participating in the conversation?"
Sounds difficult. I am not able to sew. (laughs)
"So, um, did you do pretty well in that?"
I receive all the money from my father.
"That works too, [RD-NAME-2]. You can go. [laughter]"
What does it mean to be sufficiently black?
So then you graduated from C- High School.
How do you think your mom defines success?
"Her name, I think, is her last name."
She wouldn't let me do anything for her.

"Mm. No, they don't participate in these activities."
"I don't want a lot, just some clothes."
"Man, you all had a lot of them."
I didn't know you didn't go to prom.
It's nice to raise your children out there.
What do kids do when school is out?
And I've always been that type of person.
"Wow. She just said, go in there and."
But then I remember what the thing was.
"And you know, I never found that shoe."
And you just know how to make it.
"Okay, I was more adventurous in the past."
What are you currently studying in Social Studies?
(Laugh) It's like a pound of sugar. It's
But come back in three or four months.

I didn't realize how large it was.
Dern. How many children do you have?
And do you think it was fair?
"Yes. , Why did you like her?"
What kind of things do you read?
It's a good thing if it doesn't.
I love myself. I love my hometown.
"It's not in Virginia, it's in Richmond."
"And Southern Terrace, that's another trailer park."
How many people are on a team?
I really enjoy helping people a lot.
"Sometimes, guys come over from East Tarboro."
"It's like Busch Gardens, but it's enjoyable."
"Thank you, we are trying our best."
And they don't like people from DC.

Her mother instructed Sister to strike her.
So it's kind of crazy. We had.

I attended high school in this area.
"Yeah, I know, we talked about it."
"That's a serious conversation, isn't it crazy?"
"Yes, so, I don't have that problem."
"And that, like, completely disrupts your life."
Your parents' house was located over there?
Do you understand what I'm saying? Uh.
I would like to return to college.
"It's not, it's not. Yeah, you're right."
You don't know? Laugh. It's okay. Laugh.

Are there any um-

"Oh, well that's exciting."
I just bought pants.
That is really cool.
To this other person
I am very loyal.
"Minnie, you don't understand."
I think the governor.
Did you ever feel?
It's a change.
"Like, sweetheart, sweetheart."
Perhaps one day.

"In Rochester? I don't want to. But, it's all about my job situation. I'm trying to- I wanna go wherever my union is so I can keep all my benefits and everything going, you know. Unless I switch to another hospital, that's gonna let me switch over for my pay and like- and let me- let my 401k and everything come to- like, you know, switch over. Like my boy just did that to Florida but, I'm thinking more like Seattle. Know what I mean, I was down there like two months ago, and like, yeah, Seattle."
"She will say that, but I would think she would feel like sisters too. But it's just weird because when we are in public, and I call her Ma, she says, oh, don't call me Ma in public. We try to guess my age. And we always laugh about it because we say, that's not your daughter. She says, yes, that's my daughter. But it's more like sisters and my grandma is just like, my mother."
"Um, well, when I was sixteen I lived on the East Side. In the neighborhood. It was really like that. I hate when people say it's just a regular neighborhood like Culver Road. No, it's not. You've never lived in a place where someone got shot and there are bullet holes in your bedroom, and people are chasing you because they want your coat and they don't have one and it's cold. Like,"
"We simply don't, it's like we don't even like Baltimore. (laughing) I don't know, it's a thing. First of all, people from Washington DC, like, pure DC, do not consider Baltimore as part of their territory at all. It's like, (laugh) they never get along. But, um, I don't know, it's just a thing, like we don't like it. People from Baltimore, Maryland, just Baltimore, we don't acknowledge them as part of"
"Of course, I developed new friendships. I still have friends from there to this day. Uh, I have two very good friends that I still talk to. And the rest of the people, I don't really want to be associated with any of the people that went to that school."
"Wasn't that. Today, it has gotten worse. Half of these kids we can't talk to. And I don't think- I really don't think it has changed. Not at all. The- But it- it- through a lot of these bad kids, there are some good kids mixed in them."
I remember a place called cuchifrito that I used to go to. I have memories of going to the cuchifrito place after the hospital to get some soup. They had a nice little chicken soup. I could go to the cuchifrito place and get that soup.
"I used to play with it, and wrestle with it, and do all those sorts of things. I was probably around nine years old at that time. Then, I developed an interest in chickens. Interestingly, they also had chickens in the same city, Washington DC."
"And they called a lawyer, looked on my scanner, he had that. And then, in less than ten minutes, they were fighting back around the backside up in there. So, it's just one of those things that happen a lot of times, I tell you."
"Um, hopefully I have my Registered Nurse (RN) or my Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) by then. And, um, working probably as a traveling nurse. And, um, probably started my career in opening a senior living home. I want to open a senior living home."
"Uh, like I said, I started in the first grade, and from there I jumped from first to third. I have a good memory. But I forget sometimes too, getting old now, you know? When I get as old as you are, then I forget to shut up, you know? Well anyway, anyway, well that's where I went to school, and as I mentioned, it was challenging and all that, for many years. And I wasn't in my teens, I was in my twenties then."
"Well, they had three of them. They had the twenties, the tens, and the nineteens. The tens were the cheapest. We had the tens. And they liked shoes that closed in the front and opened up in the back with a strap."
"Oh well, I have always thought seriously about the dentistry field from around fifteen or sixteen, but when I was younger than that, I wanted to be the average thing like a nurse, a cowgirl, a fireman, or anything, you know."
"Yeah. Now, RD-NAME-2 from goals, I think is the one who gave me your contact info. She said that you were also knowledgeable about one of the issues that I've been involved with, which is the Seward Park Urban Renewal Site."
"So yeah, I kind of like Seattle and if not, I like North Carolina. You know what I mean, so we're going to see. But it's eleven ninety-nine, I'm just trying to find a way to bid out with them. So, I'm at like three years right now. I need like one more year for my seniority, to start working on bidding through jobs. Cause I like what I do, and I know my job is always going to be there."
"So we, um, began talking. And then we simply fell in love and I dated for approximately, um, let me see, about eleven, eleven years. And we got married and we have been married for about, um, three, three years."
"And after they came in, there were no more cats. (laughing) So, then all of a sudden, there were a bunch of Chinese restaurants. So, you know, she always tells me, don't eat at any Chinese food restaurants."
"No. It's like, you would never see a person from Baltimore in DC, and you never see someone from DC in Baltimore. It just doesn't happen. Like, I've been to Baltimore probably three times in my life."
"I'm from New York, but I consider myself like where my mom is from. And like, because, I love that type of music. I love the whole, carnival experience. The whole- you know, everything about it, it's"
"I mean, I've been staying at home. Just like I was telling my girlfriend, she said, ""/RD-NAME-2/, I know you do it. "" When my grandkids went with me, I stayed at home. /RD-NAME-2/, for like two or three days. Oh, we had nothing to eat. But I'm happy. I go in there, I get myself some ice water, I go into their room, and I sit. I watch TV. I don't go to clubs. I go to work, I go home, I go to bed, I get up, I do things in my house, and wait until it's time for me to go to work. Then I'm back to"
"But, as long as they are helping disadvantaged children, the child who is disadvantaged is being discriminated against. He needs something that the child who is not disadvantaged doesn't need. Do you understand what I mean?"
"I told him that all I remember is that he is over seven feet tall. And he was just a tall uncle. That's all. Tall uncle. So, uh, but he was never really there growing up. And I don't know if it's because he felt a difference between- You know, we're big on, we're [RD-NAME-1]. And like you always hear- it's like, we'll never deny the fact that we're [RD-NAME-1]."
"Mm-, clears throat, Typically, we would finish school, play around, enter the store. , You know, fool around in the store and then leave. , We would play for about an hour before heading home."
"And of course, um, because I got that promotion, it was- I had little trouble getting that promotion. As a matter of fact, I had trouble getting my promotion both to Captain and Battalion Chief."
"The structure was, was, was what made it? Was it because it was a religious school? Do you feel like, um, just because, like, what made you feel like you had to be respectful?"
"Oh. So, is it like, but now you ride it alone? Do most kids ride the Metro or ride the bus and train by themselves? What's the craziest thing you've seen on the Metro?"
"Uh, if you got hit, well, we played with everybody in the middle, one person on each side. And if you got hit you were out. Somebody caught it, you got back in."
"And, you know what I'm saying, like, we'll be there, we'll go hot box. We'll leave out of there, and, um, it's like, in the early hours of the morning, people get hungry."
"And it was just like, I mean, we- Everyday all of us- You would see about thirty five kids riding down the street on bikes. We would just get together, go bike riding."
"And uh, the Christmas after, last Christmas, after last Christmas, I got a poodle. I saw it in the book, and I wrote it down on paper, and I got the same poodle."
"You know, if you're going to do something that's, you know, outside of going to college and, you know, going to, outside the norm, well, you might as well be great at it."
"And um, at the end, when they were severely injured from being shot, the police, without hesitation, began firing at them. You know, five machine guns, just completely shot all of them."
"Yeah, I don't know. I just know she ended up going to Carroll and yeah. But most people, if you go to RD-SCHOOL-1, you're supposed to go to Deal and then Wilson."
"Um, kind of, but when you think about the word Rochester, I say Rochester. I don't really know why, but I do. Maybe I trained myself to say it a long time ago, but I always hear people saying Rochester or Rochester. Which is terrible. I don't know why anybody would say that. But the emphasis is on different parts of it. And I feel like when it is, you can tell that somebody is either from here, or from somewhere very far away from here and they don't know how to say the word."
"And she gets angry because if there are a lot of children in the hallway, she asks us if we know them. And if we say we know them but can't tell her their names because they would retaliate against us, she gets even angrier. After school, she calls the office and tells them that we know the names. However, we refuse to tell her, and she informs the office about it. Then the principal or assistant principal would come up there and ask us if we didn't tell, and they threaten to suspend us."
"Yes, I remember it. And then you also did that one for, um, or you did a piece of that one for when we went out to, um, the Country Club."
"And when I am doing my work, she will say I wasn't doing it. And she could see me clearly in that - see me doing my work and not talking."
"Well, like, you know, not ""it, "" but is there ever a way that you can say it by using a rhyme? And choose people who are going to be ""it""?"
And we are still friends. We are still friends. We ended up graduating together and this year we are actually graduating from college together because we went to Fayetteville State.
I couldn't understand the first part. There are different types of games. Is there a game where a group of kids hide from one kid who has to find them?
"The last boyfriend I was with, the one I had, the boyfriend I had, I went to Hershey Park with the club, the Javelin club that I'm a part of."
"But, I don't know, natural hair comes in a lot of different. It took me a long time to realize that natural hair can be straight if that's your texture."
"I grew up in Forestville, Maryland, which is sometimes called District Heights, Maryland, and um, I went to school in Northeast as a kid, um, when we first moved here. Then I went to schools in Maryland, but now I live back in Northeast, in Lincoln Heights. So Forestville and Lincoln Heights are where I- where I've resided."
"The winter was extremely cold, and it was great. However, it's interesting because, despite enjoying those books, I couldn't relate to them. Even though I was reading those books,"
"Man, oh my goodness, I mean, what was going on was that I kept avoiding that stuff. You know, back in the day, I had to walk to school."
"Ready. Ready for- Matter- It was so bad with me on Saturday mornings- Think it was twelve o'clock, /RD-NAME-1/? They usually, um, tone everybody out at the whistle blow."
"And, um, if, uh, once I finished my homework, I was allowed to go outside and play. I didn't have to watch TV if I didn't feel like it."
"so there was no reason to keep bringing it up to her. So, um, when I was ten, my mother and I went all over the town, you know, nobody bothered me. Like, my grandmother picked peaches in season, and we didn't have babysitters. So after I finished doing my, I so-called did my chores. (laughing)"
"Yes. , Yes. , I didn't think there were grizzly bears. Boy, I'm learning more things today. <laugh>, I didn't know they were that far east. I thought-"
"Okay. Um, during my time at RD-SCHOOL-2, I pursued a minor in Writer-Confessional Writing. Um, I wrote a paper discussing an identity crisis that I experienced due to"
"I am not familiar with them. They might recognize me as someone who resembles my mother, you know, that's probably why some of them approach me on the street. They ask if I am [RD-NAME-2]. Sometimes I say yes, sometimes I say no. [You look just like somebody I know. I'm like, oh, ]"
"No, I didn't. When I was a child, I have always been interested in history. I have always watched the History Channel. Like, I always love history."
"Yes, . Well, what do you do in RD-NAME-3's sewing class? You're in a sewing class, but I want to talk about your sewing class now. [laughter]"
"I just know my dad is very, very protective of his children. Now, I mean, he loves his wife so much because they are very similar. He's-"
"Um, and it was just hilarious to us, that um- And just education was important to her. Like, my fondest memories of her are her- She lived in a three level townhouse, so we would literally go all the way up to the top and count every single one of those steps back and forth until we learned how to count. That's how all of us- like, literally it's how all Branch [RD-NAME-1] children learned how to count the steps."
"That made it different. Because he knew how to communicate with athletes. Do you think that made it different? Like if he wasn't a coach, it wouldn't have mattered to you. Not mattered, but it wouldn't have had the same impact on you, it wouldn't have resonated with you in the same way."
"Um, and I really miss that, but uh, we just went for walks. There's a pool down the street from my grandmother's house. Um, riding bikes. Um, my dad was a- We had our issues now, but back at that time, like he was very hands-on, outside, playground or you know, we're gonna just walk and explore today, type thing. Um, but I say like, if I really think about it, majority of our time was spent jumping on those stoops. And I don't know why it entertained us for hours, but we would literally jump from stoop to stoop."
"Just about anything. I don't know. I enjoy watching cartoons and sometimes shows like Mission Impossible and Combat, as well as pretty much any program."
"Even now that I'm in Greensboro, I was telling my mom the other day that I want my child to go to school down here."
"And you had to do everything we did, you know, couldn't tell on us if we did this or couldn't tell if we did that."
Oh. Mm-hm. What if a new kid moved into your neighborhood and wanted to play with all of you? What would they have to do?
"And he walked in his sleep all at five o'clock, six o'clock in the morning. He walked in his sleep up to his friend's house."
"And then, um, it's more like, it's more like the people look, uh, ask me for directions and don't look at me in my eye."
"So, she told me that she put a curse on Barnabas and said he would never die, but have eternal life. However, he sleeps during the day. But the Doctor cured him of that in 1968, and they created a man named Adam using other people's arms and legs."
"Um. There's a very strong, but quiet community control. Your zoning is very specific. And if you don't live there, you don't really notice it. But there's a lot of money and a lot of power, and a lot of influence upon making those places look a specific way."
"So I think, um, people in general. And it's crazy how I'm seventeen and all this is coming out of my mouth. But um, I feel like just people in general, they always like- People always smiling. People are always like, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. When you look at somebody's eyes, you can see them tired. You can see them sad. And you can see like, maybe I was talking right now, but you will never know in like a few more seconds I might break down. But you could see that in my eyes."
"And actually, he really experienced the hardships. Instead of, he didn't, he wasn't proud of it but it was something he discussed, he wasn't ashamed of it. Nowadays, people want to pretend to experience hardships, to think that it's cool or that's what's popular. No. It's not a-"
"And the dog, well, it ran upstairs. And I had, well, I had about nine hundred dollars up there, you know, in my upstairs."
"How did you- What happened when you came back into town, did you- Once the flood waters came down, what was it like here?"
"She purchased a house in Maryland. And then, when I was born, that's where she already established her residence. So, that's where I lived."
"When you mention culture, can you provide an example? You mentioned that DC has its own culture, so can you give me an example?"
I don't know. I want to study diligently to become a doctor. I want to work in a hospital and have my own office.
"Hmm, no I don't really think so. Um, once I was in a car accident, which wasn't really very much of a car accident. No one was hurt or anything. That's about, I don't know, I guess that's about the closest I've ever gotten to it."
"Yeah, of course they do. Leave them out of it, huh? <laugh> Well, where do you go when you, um, when you drink?"
"So I'm- , Um, no actually my, my oldest brother just came back, he just moved back with us. , Um, my oldest-"
"How about if somebody gave you, all of the money in the world, several million dollars then what would you do with it?"
"Very good. How about, um, any other occasion where you were in a situation where, with a group of guys or something, and you thought, oh man, this is it. I'm going to get it now. Have you ever been in that type of situation?"
"Um, do you feel like you're kind of excluded or not fully included in the group? Um, do you continue to go back to DC for any other purpose? Like, do you go there just to spend time with your friends? Or is it mostly"
"They are imitating the negative behaviors of their fathers and uncles. My father is in prison, and that's the only life I've known. However, we need to break that cycle. You need to have faith in the Lord rather than following your father's actions, especially if they are not aligned with the Lord's teachings. So, I believe Proverbs chapters three, verses five and six would be the message I would convey. If I could offer any advice, that would summarize what a person should do with their life."
"Anyway, so, um, that's why this here, um, um, forget this girl's name. She can't even understand me because she says I'm articulate. He's articulate too, but you see, he needs experience before he can speak confidently. I can speak confidently without any assistance."
"So let me ask you this because I've heard about this Horse and Dickie, I've never had food from there. Um, where are some other- So, besides them cause I know they're very close. People from the office still get stuff from there, right?"
"You mentioned it had been great. What do you mean when you use the word ""tight""? That's a slang term, isn't it?"
"Oh, we would take turns. We would count in increments of two, but it's not the standard way of counting by twos."
"""for Christmas? Well usually, I go to a party every night, and we celebrate Christmas day. And my grandmother comes over. """
"Yeah, there is someone that I no longer communicate with. And, um, and then obviously, like, I dated [RD-NAME-1] after high school."
"And that's what I noticed. They, they, like even on Minnesota Avenue, there's a Popeye's right there. I noticed that. They did."
"Yeah, just. Mm mm mm. And years ago, before, um. Mister. Doctor. Why can't I think? A doctor that we had here."
"Um, and she's telling me that RD-NAME-3 was also there, but he didn't live with us. And I remember Mom and Dad had a small toddler bed, like a very small toddler bed, and we slept right beside them in the bed. And I tell her, and she's like, I can't believe you remember that. But I remember that we slept beside them."
"So, I stay on them and tell them, it's just, you need to do what you need to do in school."
"Like I- but like I always say, I watch you and /RD-NAME-2/ and /RD-NAME-2/ keep doing your thing, man. It's awesome."
"I write poetry, you know what I'm saying, and I spit poetry bars. Like people write that stuff in their class."
"Recognize accents from upstate, such as those from New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, and Philly. They do have accents, you know."
"Why is this only happening to me? So, I'm seeing just a lot of, how my community is being singled out."
"Uh, well if, I mean if I haven't seen it in a long time, do I still have to give you-"
"Yeah. Well now it's called Six Flags. It's in, um, in Largo. But it used to be called Wild World. When we were kids coming up, we used to go there. It was like a big deal. And then it was turned into Adventure World. And they turned it into, uh, Six Flags. But it's still there but it's just seeing like the name changes and the rides and everything as a kid, going there now and seeing it now, it's just crazy. You know what I'm saying? Coming from a kid that was like a big deal to us going over there. So."
"What is the other one? Um, I can't remember all the other majors and what they are called. Science and Mathematics or something. Well, whatever. They announce your name and everything. You get to shake their hand and receive your awards."
"I started counting and I think about six or seven times in a row, I just throw out and set the line down and hold it between my knees. Then, I'd put the other two fish on the line. And then by then, I'd just wind it up again, and I have two more fish to take off and put down."
"Because my mom, my grandma became bipolar, my grandfather started drinking. So he was addicted to alcohol for a while and then we think that's what made him become like, it messed with him so much that he started getting dementia and now Alzheimer's. And then her brother is no help because it's not his fault he's schizophrenic but he's just no help because of that. So it's all been on her so she doesn't really care about presents and stuff."
But it doesn't have anything to do with the demographics of the area. Or the fact that I feel like the city is divided by race. I think it's just the location. I'm only considering the house or the apartment.
"Because she had guests, I don't want to eat the way I want. I mean, I'm not going to eat the way I want to eat. I might want a lot of food, and I was embarrassed to get it."
"Because you haven't told me about it, so this is as good a time as any to talk about it."
"Every time I go to the gym, I always check the thing to see if your name is still there."
"Um, me and I went back to RD-SCHOOL-3 for grad school and in two thousand eight I got my master's."
"Yeah because she- because we um- Well, so from my family's side, I don't have like first cousins around them."
He lost his shoe because he left his shoe. We were sitting on the porch and I saw it outside.
"Your mother was born in Southeast, and your father was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. What do your parents do?"
"And then they stayed with her, they asked her if they could stay with her and all. It was fun."
"And I kept saying, I want to go home. I want to go home. And so that's what, that was."
This is something. Let me connect it. That was a police. This was a program reaching out to the community.
"We're going to a new city, I need my mother. So, he just really energized the whole city and he made it popular and attractive. He made DC like- we've had more celebrities come here now since Obama has been in office than ever before. I mean, he made it like a new popular destination. So, thank you Obama."
"And I didn't, like, I didn't like certain aspects of living here. But like I told you, in the beginning, I had this was a very special place, but I didn't know that then. Nor did I appreciate it."
"Exactly. And if it was a team though, um, you would catch me and I would just be out for the rest- you know, there was like a- a prisoner's thing, where I would have to stay there."
"I'm paving the way so that way, I can be like Will and Jada, you know, like the new and real version of them. (pause) <laugh> (pause) God damn, like seriously, my child can do whatever they want."
"What are you doing in the summer now? Um, can you please describe a regular day from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed during the summer. What activities do you engage in?"
"And it's like a community, a family community, and if, like, my mom didn't have to worry about me going somewhere and anybody doing anything to me and she not knowing about it cause news got around fast."
"And um, I enjoy Christmas because I like to decorate the tree and it looks beautiful once it's decorated."
I understand what you're saying. It's crucial to unite and spend time with your family. That holds great significance.
"And I am glad it was like, adult, it was like over twenty-five, and it wasn't like, the little-"
"Yes, do you recall an incident on Star Trek that you can share a story about, something you witnessed?"
"Yes, I agree, I agree. Um, so let me ask you about mumbo sauce. Do you eat mumbo sauce?"
"Of course. Personally, I never went to school with any white people. I haven't. The first time I was introduced to white people was when I went to RD-SCHOOL-2. So I've been around black people my whole life. I don't even know how it is to interact with white people. I mean, I do now, but"
"So do you see, I want to talk about your high school in a minute, because I've heard some interesting stories about /RD-SCHOOL-2/, but do you see, are turf wars like real? Do you see that happening?"
"I was thinking about, well, let me start, let me go back. So tell me a little bit about your neighborhood, the neighborhood that you most connected with when you were little, and it may be two or three different ones. Tell me about growing up, maybe your house, and the street you lived on."
"Yes. , Good. , How about within the group of guys you hang out with, is there someone that everyone tends to listen to? He's a leader. , What qualities or characteristics make him a leader?"
"So then he said, ""So, then [RD-NAME-2] was my brother. [RD-NAME-2] was mad in a way, "" and I was also mad in a way. But I didn't want to say anything to hurt his feelings."
"But, that's the way it was back then, we were scared of them. So, um, and another thing, um, we were more accepting of people, same sex, being in love or caring about each other too."
Please share your experience of growing up as a middle child and provide some information about your brothers.
Is the- you uh- you w- going- at one point you said you went to the community college?
"Oh okay. So what did they do? What, would- did they- did they work here in town or?"
"Yeah. It's, you have to look at it in, to me, it will help you out in life."
"Yeah. I only eat it on my fries though. I don't, I don't put it on the chicken."
"Then, all the children and some of my aunts and uncles were in the very back, big room."
"You know, like my grandma, when she told me, oh, don't eat that, don't, I mean, that's serious."
"No, it didn't, but when I look at it now, I know we were cramped, but I didn't."
It doesn't even look like it's sturdy. I wouldn't want to live there because I would think it's
"Hmm, that's great. I'm going to change the subject a little. Do you have a pet? Right now?"
"Um, you know, even to the point where, you know, when you look at Baltimore and DC, there's a clear distinction. Because Baltimore actually decided to take more of a New York approach to how they approach culture. Whereas DC had its own thing, and that's why there's still a distinction between Baltimore and DC. Um, another thing, like, growing up in DC, people don't understand, people ask about go-go music. They have no clue. They don't understand what it is, what it means, why we love it, what it is. Um, the reason why go-go was so popular growing up was because it was our artist."
"First Street and K. Still a school up there now, but I mean, it's no concern what building it was. Young boys, uh, something about what they did by the police car, and another building next to it. Anyway, we're there at the Jones, RD-NAME-3. RD-NAME-3. I was in Seven B then."
"So I'm like, it's a no-brainer, sign me up. She's like, well, the deadline is in two days. So, get to work. So, I went and found a computer and was just frantically typing. Now RD-WORK-4 is like, extensive. It's basically slightly less extensive than the Peace Corps. Cause I found out the Peace Corps, you have to do video interviews and Skype and all that. But, um,"
"Yup, but I never had my own room. I always- well, when we were younger, I used to- my big sister had her own room, cause that's when she was in her teenage stage."
"Mm-hm. That's good, that's a good aspiration. What is it that you think you- Well, what is it that you have to do in order to, say, reach that goal of being a doctor?"
"And I was, you know, I was, at certain times that was a reality to me, so. And be able to come from that and to be where I am now, is, you know."
"At the club. Okay, so now I know. Now I'm a little better oriented where you are."
"Just give them an F, and bring them to Miss [RD-NAME-2]. Miss [RD-NAME-2], suspend them from school."
"I see them out there, enthusiastically jumping around, enjoying the water. It makes you feel really good."
"Maybe next time you have a project, well, you won't do the same project again, will you?"
"How about if, uh, you had to do it all over again, if you had to live?"
"A while before he, cause he sees how my youngest son is having some difficulties, you know."
"But you know, it was like, I was ready for it. You know, ready to go off."
"Is that the high school that has, um, a great yard? With the skate park and everything?"
"I don't like go go music. That's another thing, I'm not a fan of go go music."
"Before it's time for us to play with our toys, I play with them before it's time."
"Southeast is, I mean you probably don't even remember, I don't know if you were aw- Not that you don't remember, you may just not have been aware because you were eight, six."
"Last year we did a peaceful protest on July eighth. And, um, me and my friends were actually part of the people who were organizing it and keeping it together and running it. And, I mean, that was about the police brutality, and everybody was getting shot across America, really for no apparent reason. And the way it ended was very ironic. Like, we were met with police with riot gear and tear gas, and they ended up arresting seventy-four people. And it's like, nobody did anything to them. Literally, being there, being a part of it, knowing what the mission is, knowing how we were managing, everything. It was completely peaceful."
"Oh yeah, I think I did that too. Did you ever play double dutch? Yeah, I said that too. Did you have a specific phrase you used when you played double dutch?"
"This, um, when she stayed in Ashton Park, that's when I went to RD-SCHOOL-4. That was my second, I don't know, I would say that was my second, third, and fourth grade."
Man. I called and made numerous complaints. And I don't know how many fines they received.
"Oh, so she was strict, huh? Did you ever have a teacher that yelled a lot?"
But I wouldn't want to go and wait for someone and then I fell or something.
Do you ever have the opportunity to participate in any acting or dancing activities at school?
"Because these individuals, like, the young stars, who were, the coach's son, removed me from defense."
Okay. And where does the rest of your family live? Are they scattered all over or?
"A teacher, yes. Well, what do you believe you need to do to become a teacher?"
"Okay. So, tell me about your trajectory. Did you go in the order that was mentioned?"
I understand. Do you ever play a game where one child has to chase everyone else?
"Um, were you ever in a place where you thought you might die or be killed?"
"They said, ""RD-NAME-1, come here, "" and his name was RD-NAME-1. His nickname is Blue Cheese."
"And some of them, well, they, we'll work together if there's nothing going on like that."
"I understand. However, I still don't like it. That's why I hardly know anything about it."
I don't know how to actually play it. And I do know how to play soccer.
"Miss [RD-NAME-2]. No, her name is not Miss [RD-NAME-2]. Are you referring to this year? Or?"
"I have never taken a taxi while I was here. No, I have my own car."
"Now you said you, uh, you, um, didn't finish school? Did- How far did you get?"
"And then, um, I had a bird that my father accidentally stepped on, and she died."
"When I achieve success in the seventh grade, or when January 1st arrives, when I make my resolutions, I'm going to declare that I will put in more effort. Just like one of my teachers advised me in school, I will strive to progress rather than regress. I will begin at the first step and work my way up to the last."
"Yeah, I had a sister. She died last year. She was in the flood with me. I love her. Then she died last April. And her children still live in Princeville."
"Hey, like I mentioned earlier, how are you? You know, oh boy, and all that, you know. That's just the way I am with her today, and her boyfriend as well."
"Cause if you find yourself thinking, ""Oh no, why am I doing this? I'm doing too much. "" Like, when it comes to a person, I don't think you love them."
"- you know, or I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna spend time with him because he's, you know, he's- you know, so, such and such nationality. It was never like that."
"Just try not to fall into the trap of feeling like you have to conform to a certain image. Just be yourself. Try not to focus on trying to impress your friends and females. Just figure out what you want to do and follow that path because, as a child, I never really cared about what other people thought about me."
"Oh, New Year's Eve? Oh! Well, last year on New Year's Eve, the lady who lives up the street gave a, um, hmm, I was. That was. , Yeah, last New Year's Eve, and um, hmm, you know, she had a mistletoe over the door. Whoever would come behind a boy, had to kiss him and everything, you know. <laugh>"
"I go up there during the summer, and she comes down here during the summer. So she wanted me to come up this summer because she couldn't come down here."
"Alright, so I'm going to come back to poetry because I know that's a big part of your interest. We are going to revisit that shortly. We will come back."
And then RD-NAME-2's mom wanted me to do her hair show. And I did her hair show for like three years straight. And then it just went on from there.
"Well now that you're a pescatarian, I don't know if this one is as relevant."
"If they have any children, I assist them with their homework or a similar task."
"Travel-wise, you know, um, we have buses and trains running every day. I said, honey,"
"Yes. , Well, who was it that didn't want African American people in their family?"
"Oh, let me talk to you for a moment, young lady. Some stuff like that."
"Man, on that specific night when I met RD-NAME-1, I was taking a Lyft, so."
"How, like, how far north does it go? Like, how far north would you go?"
"Yes. Yeah. That was one of the greatest lessons though that RD-SCHOOL-2 taught me, so."
"And that- Yeah, but- Yeah. I mean, growing up, I really didn't know as much."
"Hm. Well, um, I mean, you don't have a specific group of friends, you know,"
"Are you still, um, do you still live in, uh, you live in Waldorf now?"
"Um, I believe it was pre-K. Pause 0. 67 seconds. Pre-K, I attended, I attended when I, when I was, I recall that being my very first school experience."
"Yeah, they might, but they're doing more than just stripping or exotic dancing, which is the technical term. So, the lifestyle that comes with it is definitely not appealing."
"Please hold the end of it up. You know, those things that you. when you tweeze it in. I mean, tweeze it in. You push. you ride it in."
"The old cupboard. And I looked outside and there was something covering the window outside. Because you could see the water starting to show, the white part was visible."
"A lot of people. No, a lot of younger people. A lot of young people say that, lunching, like, you're lunching. But I don't think, yeah, a lot of young people say it, I don't think a lot of older people say it."
"I was talking about a bicycle. They have a three-wheel bicycle. One wheel is in front, and two wheels are behind. I used to break it down and call it a racer. (pause) I mean, like, you know, with the old empty cars, something like that. (pause) I would get behind it and pretend to drive. (pause) They didn't go anywhere, just. just, you know, fooling with the wheel. (laugh)"
"And, we throw the rock on, number one, and we, s- we jump in number two on one foot up to ten and jump back and, stand on one foot and pick the rock up, and jump off. And if you can get it, the rock into ten, and do the same, you win the game."
". Street. And. The police have to go into a building or another area, and what they will do, they will patrol, check every staircase of the co-"
"The way businesses operate. Yeah, there, this stuff, and the way landlords harass residents."
I think that's why you and RD-NAME-3 get along because she's your mom's age.
Right down the street from my house. I live on RD-ADDRESS-1 and RD-ADDRESS-1. Yeah.
"But hey man, thank goodness we live in such a great country called America."
Okay. It sounds familiar. I feel like I should know what movie that is.
I don't know. She was just so terrible that she really needed it though.
"Because the AKs, then the Deltas broke off. That's why they're called Deltas, right?"
"He is currently saying that, but she is deceased. Nobody knows how it happened."
"So, you see bars and, I'm twenty-one, and I'm like, yeah, I can drink."
"Uh, it's in Tarboro. Um, have you been at the old Black and Decker?"
Hm. And then he died in the end? Is that- Is that what happened?
"Well, you're attractive enough to accomplish it. What exactly does an airline stewardess do?"
"Well, you can't make a mistake, it's quiet. So, I chose a mortuary and-"
"Well, it's where you play Four Corner Knuckles. You shoot it from this location."
"Um, I remember one time, and you can't tell my mom about this one."
It is expensive. It is better for girls. It is more expensive for boys.
He sent his secretary up there and showed her exactly what she was doing.
"But uh, um, I don't know. You're going to have to ask specific questions."
"They discuss the experiences they have gone through. For example, hip hop music. There are some imposters out there who haven't accomplished anything. One example is a guy named Slim Jesus, who created a song called Drill Town. In the song, he talks about guns, doing drugs, and all that. However, during an interview, he says that he is not involved in street activities. It doesn't make sense. Why would he make a song about something he's not a part of? That's foolish."
"Yeah. Sh- I- she had an incident where she actually got attacked coming down here. And I know how our family is like, her sister came down here ready to fight, her mom did, it's just not- And we had to calm them down and tell them, after they calmed me down first, well, I told them like, it's not- It's gonna be another problem. Cause they know how she looks and if y'all go around there with her it's gonna be a different thing. But now I just tell her to protect herself at all times, don't- like, if you see a group of people coming or you see something that's about to go down, just find the quickest way to get"
"Alright. Great. Um, no, I was about to say the Pacquiao Mayweather fight. Did you all do something significant? Because that was the most recent major fight."
"I'm not going to do that here anymore. That would be silly. Here, I'm not going to do that here. But now, I'm more relaxed about it."
"Yes. , Were there any special names for any of the marbles? , Like, do you have a name for your favorite shooter or anything like that?"
"I think it's the same. Well, no, yeah it's crowded. It's crowded but it doesn't- after fi- I feel like it's the same thing on a block, radius type thing. It's the same amount of people. It's just that your neighbors are much closer. Like okay, you step outside on your porch, their porch is right there. Like, there's a gate dividing your porch and their porch. But when you come out and they stand there, you're gonna say, hey."
"And uh, I was outside in the yard, then she called me and told me to come over. And she wanted me to go get a piece of plywood and put it on her bed. She was in a wheelchair."
"She never did anything right. I mean, we knew more math than she did. She'd tell us something, and then we could say one thing. She'd get very confused, and she'd have to start from the very beginning again. And nobody really liked her. She was fired at the end of the year."
"Well, I enjoy Arithmetic, Reading, and Science. I really love Science, you know. Most of the time, you know, in Science - We had a lot of fun in Science because our teacher, you know - Like if you come in one day and didn't want to do anything, he understands your problem and things like that. I liked him, you know, things like that."
"Hm. Um. Okay, so tell me about how you started working at RD-WORK-3. How did you move up? Because I know at one point, well, let's back up. At one point, you wanted to go to the military, right?"
"Yeah, yeah for a while. For a while. My son wants me to switch up and go to his church but you know, I told him your church has a lot of teenagers, my church has people my age."
"Mm-hm. I mean, I know how to cheer. I just started back doing what I was cheering. Um, I dance for a dance team in DC."
"See, we can choose, we can choose whoever we want for the leader."
"Or I'll, no I'll tell you about Rosemary's Baby, did you see that?"
How about your experience in the war? Did you serve in the war?
"So, what do you do with your time now, [name]? Are you retired?"
They are just afraid to speak up. But they want to speak up.
"That's good. Um, what do you want to do when you finish school?"
"Well, that's good, that's nice. What about a teacher you just couldn't stand?"
And so he was the only one who really faced consequences for it.
"The interviewer was my old neighbor. And now, he's my friend and producer."
"Sometimes I get together and take the kids, you know, to the park."
"Yeah, right, how did- okay so, did you take a class with them?"
"I just went there and stitched it up and now, I came back."
"And they, uh, think they can do what they did in other places."
"We need, uh, six stories, seven at the most, eight at the most."
"You know what I'm saying, Like, where are the guns? You know what I'm saying, like the guns are around the corner, they say there's a party tonight. Are you going? Yeah, how many guns will be there?"
"Um, I feel like I was well-prepared when I entered fourth grade, even though I had a completely different experience. I feel like many of the kids at my middle school had attended the same school for third grade or earlier, so they were accustomed to homework and similar tasks."
"Yeah. What's your opinion on that? Some people believe that there are now two distinct neighborhoods, namely the Lower East Side and the East Village."
"Team, if you engage in a conflict, and someone else witnesses it but doesn't want, you to win the fight, they will also join in."
"And, um, let's see. Well that's about it. And I would try to make everybody just as happy as they want to be, could be."
"What did I major in, or what? I ain't no major in anything in particular but this, ordinary common sense, I put it that way."
"The best teacher I had was in the sixth grade, and, and the third, and the seventh grade, the- my English class. Yeah, Mister [RD-NAME-1]."
"I am allergic to a horse. I don't know why. But I will catch him by his, you know, by his foot, something like that."
"I said, I would, I take, you know what I'm saying, test bitches all through there, bro. We come back to school. One day I was like, forget it. I had just stayed home for a long time now, finally came back up to the school, me and my friend. Was walking back up to the school, my mom was up there trying to check me out early, bro. She saw my stupid self walking up to the school. I was. dang. (laughter) It was over, man."
"From the ceiling. And, the police came to my house and said this was the first burglary of this nature, where they could look up and see a hole. And at that time, I wasn't wise enough to know to hold the landlord accountable. And, to keep the police involved and get what I could to stay in school. Of course, I had to drop out because I had to stay home."
"She said, ""Thanks for looking"" because that's how we operated. We were like a big family, united as one. Everyone took care of each other. It wasn't about being selfish and only looking out for yourself."
"Well, she used to beat people with the ruler because they brought candy and stuff to school, and you're not supposed to bring candy."
"Yeah, they were doing that, giving away spoons and pots and uh,"
"I mean, we had to watch all of the shows as well."
"You know, and we never think about those things. Like, you know."
"Oh, I see, now, but that behavior has to be addressed though."
Did any of them speak a foreign language? Like Spanish or anything?
So she is displaying a very different kind of identity as well.
"I'm interested in participating in various activities and matters, such as that."
"Uh-huh. Any other rhymes you could use, like ""One potato, two potato""?"
Hm. Can you tell me about the best teacher you ever had?
They hosted numerous house parties where they would play go go music.
"Yeah, that's a quick way of doing it. (laughs while speaking) [laughter]"
And all that stuff is a lot better than it is now.
And what are your thoughts on the current situation with that website?
"So, between the ages of um, what, when did you leave Tarboro?"
"Hey, have you ever noticed that almost all movies have happy endings?"
"That's Barbara and RD-NAME-3, and Brenda. All three of them are seventeen."
"So I, I don't, like, try, I don't try to dwell there."
"No, that's why I'm asking, I don't know what you're talking about."
I'm not going to feel bad because my hair doesn't really curl.
"No, Houston is going north. Like, you know, from Houston to Fourteenth."
"Okay, um, for how long have you been living in Atlanta, Georgia?"
"Oh. Um, yes. Are there any Caucasian children that you interact with?"

Have you ever had a teacher that you really disliked?
"I was like, well I'm going in the complete opposite direction. Thank you God for keeping me from killing myself, but I won't be taken advantage of again, friend. So I went through a rebellious phase. I started hanging out with my older brother and some of his friends, and we were smoking weed. Just being rebellious, you know. I had a growth spurt the summer after eighth grade. I remember looking up to the sky and cursing God. Again, um, I knew God called me to live for him. I went from being suicidal and depressed to being extremely proud and thinking I don't need God within a matter of months. [laugh] Hey. The young- the young"
"Drama club, um, media team, and, um, just regular classes. I didn't do any AP classes and people were so shocked. And I felt like, I don't wanna do AP because, you know, you go through the whole class and you can make straight A's, but that one test you take at the end of the year, if you don't pass it, you fail the class. And I didn't really think, oh I won't pass it, but I'm like, what if I get sick, or I don't do- I was- I always had these what ifs. I said no, I can- I can do these so called regular classes and I can do additional stuff on my own"
"I have been here for a long time and I didn't go abroad while I was here because I didn't want to. I don't like change. I love my house, I love my mom, I love my sister, I love my dog. I did not want to leave them. But at some point, I should go experience something else."
"I worked at a hotel. I was a cook who prepared various types of meat, including fish, crabs, and lobsters. I would make dinners for the customers, you know."
"I think a lot of, a lot of it has to do with the reason why we don't have it, is not because they don't want to but just the amount of money they have to afford to keep rent open, you know. And, you know, it's tough."
"Because, you know what the thing is, um, the thing is that you could- we all grew up- everybody who's living on this block, you know, it's pretty much watched each other growing up. We've been friends, or since we were kids. You know, and so there's a"
"No, I just know they say things like, girl, you know how they phrase words. They say things like, uh, you know, just like how we talk too. Some people would say, nah, Bob, like I'm not going over there, Bob. You know, Bob is just another term. It's not somebody's name, it's nothing, it's just like, like, I'm not going over there, Bob. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm not dealing with you, Bob."
"But you know what I'm saying? You can't really understand, you know what I'm saying? You can't compare any person from DC to anyone else. We don't dress like we're from Baltimore, we don't dress like we're from Philly. We don't do any of that stuff, it's unique to us. We wear Foamposites and such, we wear New Balance and you know what I'm saying? We have our own style, we put our own outfits together."
"I would go to school, and then um, I always had to have a house. I've always wanted a house with a big yard, and I always thought that if I couldn't afford the house, I would just have the big yard. And well, cars have never meant that much to me, but it might be nice to have something to ride around in, not drive because I don't think I have that kind of patience."
"Yeah, they made it. They hit him on the face and when he went, he lived on U Street. When he went back, he had blood all over his shirt. They got him right up by his eye."
"Uh, ever since he was born, he's about four years old now. He's four years old and fully grown. I don't know why my girlfriend named him Maurice. She must have had a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend named Maurice."
"What about, um, so what, you, um, create your art, on, um, a computer, through a software, like ProTube?"
"Oh, that sounds like it was very enjoyable. Did you participate in any other similar games during your childhood?"
"Has anything changed? I mean, has the fact that the composition of the neighborhood in terms of the people"
"Yes, well I don't remember exactly how we chose the person who was ""it. "" We just started playing."
"Okay. Um, what about teachers? Did you ever have a teacher who yelled a lot? That you can remember?"
"It knocked me. You know, you could. You know I fell. I wasn't really black. I felt the pain."
We moved to Ainger Place Southeast. I remember that as if it was yesterday. We moved on Ainger Street.
"""And whoever it is, it will be the last one that's in, they'll be the one that's it. """
"Cause, if you come to DC from a different place, you might think DC is where the Governor and the President are. But when you actually see DC and go around the neighborhoods, I'm not just talking about the DC, Maryland area, I'm talking about in DC."
"For a while. And, um, it's crazy because like, family members, they tend to forget about their- Your mom, or dad, or aunts, uncles. And at the end of the day, their family becomes us, the workers. So, I just always have like a soft spot for them. And they're sweet. Like- I mean they, at some point in life, that's gonna be me, you know. So I would want somebody to care about me."
"No, the man lives next door to me. We still see each other quite a bit, but now, at fifty, I don't get around like I used to."
"We would find something to do. If, you know, there's no mall around here, but it's still Princeville. I mean, I wouldn't want to grow up anywhere else."
"I prayed to the Lord that he didn't, and God knows he didn't. And then they came back and took me. They lifted me up, and then they came and took my husband, [RD-NAME-1]. They lifted him up. And then I asked about my mother who is in a wheelchair. I said, I know they're not going to let her stay back there. And so-"
"Well, his name is /RD-NAME-1/, you know. He's. Well, he's the type of guy, you know, like, if we go and do something and he knows it's rough, he tells us not to and things like that."
"Smother it thoroughly. And so I never experienced any difficulties, uh, in a situation where, uh, I was trapped and unable to escape. I was once forced to leave a room through a window during a fire."
"Once they told my mother, my mother had to come to school and resolve the issue. So, and you didn't have the option to choose which high school to attend. If you lived on the north side of the school, you went to Franklin. If you lived on the south side of the school, you went to East. And if you were a boy, you had the choice of going to either the school on either side of the building, or you could go to Edison Tech or Paul Revere Trade Schools. They used to be located on Clifford Avenue."
"So we were playing reform school one day. So, you know she had to punish us because we were all misbehaving and such. And you know, we pretended that we killed the old lady and such. That's how we play, and you know, then she took a ruler and started hitting us. And you know, then we were at the park, so, you know, she made us do all kinds of things."
"No, this is- And what I love is, um, being able to- it was great talking to your dad first, um, because he was much more general."
"I remember I was ill. And that was the only day, and I'm thinking, we cannot reschedule this."
"I mean, unless you're on a team, then it's until four thirty, four days a week after school."
I actually do not want to stay here. I have never felt like I belong here at all.
"Jacks, that's a game I never could understand. I had sisters to explain it to me and everything."
"You know. That stuff grows with you, you know what I'm saying. Something you could take with you."
"I believe you have more African heritage than I do. It was always a significant aspect, I mean,"
Okay. What would you say are some of the most challenging aspects of being an educator at RD-SCHOOL-3?
"Yes, that sounds good. That's great. Well, um, what career do you want to pursue after completing school?"
"Yeah, I went to see Rosemary's Baby and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and um, Bonnie and Clyde."
Did you all ever play pranks on that teacher? What kind of pranks did you play on her?
"Yes, in his hand, like, if it had twenty-five cents, put five, ten, fifteen, twenty in his hand."
So you were her what? What was that position?
Last year. That's the final song that I wrote.
Isn't there a major highway that encircles Washington? That-
Which is how I met my friend Jelly. Okay.
Did she only complain about small things like that?
You miss a lot that isn't loving and kind.
"They work, you know, to build homes and everything."
Hmm. What other subjects did you study besides history?
"Uh. Well, um, around two or three, I did."
"First grade, second grade, and third grade, yes. Uh-huh."
"Yes, do you have a specific one in mind?"
What is the difference between being ten years old?
"So, we used to run past the White House."
"Oh, that's why you and RD-NAME-2 aren't friends. Oh."
But then you just talked about the gunshots and
"No. I mean, can you believe that? They're not."
"Oh, the last person stayed behind? I understand. Yes."
What about The Dating Game? What is that about?
Oh. Why do you need two pairs of skates?
"Are you, uh, so you, um, graduated from RD-SCHOOL-3?"
"But, it seems like I'm getting old. I am."
"Oh, I go to the small bank over there."
"Um, and so now I want to hear more."
But the health inspector came over and stopped her.
Can you tell me what occurred on the program?
"So they were informed about the whereabouts of Bonnie and Clyde. And then the man exited the room, as he simply wanted to know where Bonnie and Clyde were. So after he found out who Bonnie and Clyde were, they, um. And then, you know, they attempted to apprehend her. And then. And then. Then Bonnie and Clyde went to another house."
"And so anyway, she said, um, I'm not going to allow you to have my child held back. And so the principal was familiar with my grandmother because it was an old school. You know, RD-SCHOOL-3? That's an old school. My grandmother attended it."
"Well, I applied for the communications program. Oh, I forgot in terms of my education, um, I also did a summer between, yeah. So my summer between eleventh and twelfth grade, I went to Syracuse."
"Do you get any benefits on your car insurance if you take classes? Like, does it become cheaper? Like, if we took a driver's education course at our school, your insurance would be less expensive."
"Um, let me ask you because I want to understand, but first, I have to ask you, what do you think are the boundaries of the Lower East Side? Like geographically. Where are the streets?"
"Now, if they purchased Ricky's building for one hundred and seventy million. Uh-huh. Do you understand? How much are they willing to pay for these two?"
"Mm. You didn't join a union. Okay, here's a question that's going to test your imagination. Suppose someone were to give you all the money you ever wanted in the world. What would you do with it? Have you ever thought about that?"
"Okay, okay. No, I really, really understand that. Um, let's think, even without any specific reason, what do you think about the entire R Kelly situation if you've heard about it? Anything, have you heard anything in the news recently about R Kelly?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, there isn't really much in DC that's- unless you go downtown. That we don't have many restaurants that people- that you would spend money on. DC is like the- the city unless you go to downtown or somewhere where the white people- where they- you know what I'm saying, where they spend the money."
"And that was the Popeyes of the sixties, you know. Yeah. Pretty much, you know. Uh, back in the sixties you know we had places like um, Hot Shoppes Jr. Hot Shoppes- Hot Shoppes Jr. used to- that later became um, I believe it later became places like Kentucky Fried Chicken."
"But me, I just saw it as an opportunity. Like, if there's a homeless person, I want to try to help them, the best way I can. I have given money, I have bought food for them. You know, because I understand the struggle. I know it's very difficult out here."
"The way people think is just different. You know various things, and let me think. My younger sister is ten. I share everything with her and answer her questions. She has a boyfriend who lives across the street. <laugh> I told her she should start learning the facts when she's young."
"I don't know! Like, I just don't know. People tell me I speak like a white person and that I'm an Oreo. And I don't know. Because there's no one way of being black, in my opinion. So I don't understand why people are saying that to me. I don't know."
"Yes, that sounds like a good game. Um, do you know any more of those little songs that you sing to choose who's ""it"" besides my mother and your mother? Are there any others?"
"Even though I attended RD-SCHOOL-2, I wasn't influenced by that school. So I was always the one completing all my homework and achieving good grades, unlike everyone else around me who didn't do anything."
How did you end up at RD-WORK-4? Because there are other community centers and those two things.
"Well, well, I tell you, uh, I understand that the correct pronunciation for it is I Spy."
A couple. I have so many things I wanted to ask about. Thinking about the Civil Rights.
"Did you have any? So, what grade would you have been in here until you were eleven?"
"You know what I'm saying. Other than that, yeah, man. I heard you mention mumbo sauce earlier."
"It happened on New Year's Eve. And there was this man, he was wearing all white. And there was this boy who had just received his paycheck, three hundred dollars. When I was outside the store, I saw him. The man was counting out three hundred dollars and putting it in his hand. He must have had that three hundred dollars on him when he went out on New Year's Eve. Some boys, they jumped him and took all of his clothes and all his money, except for his shoes and his shirt."
"And uh, so like we had- how many? So it was my mother's room, my grandmother's room, which is now in the basement, and then we had /RD-NAME-2/'s room. And then we had like- It was like this extra room in there."
"And after I had just arrived, and I didn't have a pager. Then the whistle blew. I ran from the house down here. And I'm just looking around. I'm thinking, where is everyone? That's when I found out, on Saturday morning around twelve, they test everyone's pagers and the siren."
"Yeah. I mean, you're correct, but I attempted to maintain that objective and consider that even if my heart gets broken, I still know- at least know that I can- I can attempt to be with someone without manipulation, relying on the success or reputation of something else, or like-"
"On a typical weekend, I would probably go out to a party, a club, a lounge, or go bowling. Maybe even something like a studio."
"Do you play the organ? Yes. Oh, that is really nice. An organ! What a Christmas present. How could you ask for anything more? <laugh>"
"But the thing is, he ran and sat up beside the open area for two to three days, or maybe even a couple of weeks."
"The Standard American English. And, but then I learned how they say it in the South. And this is how they say it in the North and the Midwest and. And it just became overwhelming. It was too much. It was. a lot. It wasn't just a lesson. When all I wanted was. Because language is so. I don't know the word. Expressive and yet, elusive."
"Two fifty. So yeah, that's why I say yeah, back in our day it was much better, you know. We didn't have as many homeless people on the street back in our days, but now, with the generation today, I walk around sometimes and I just see too many. I see too many homeless people, I'm like, Lord why do we have so many homeless people?"
"I used to work as a Youth Discipleship Director. My role involved overseeing the creative aspects of the youth ministry, as well as teaching the kids and supervising their small group activities. We would divide the kids into groups and have discussions about what we learned in church, breaking it down for them. So, my responsibilities included implementing creative ideas and teaching at the youth ministry."
"In the evenings, I used to come home and sit down and try to count my money or run my ribbons. You know, I used to have to run all those ribbons, see?"
"It's, you have to think about it, it's, how many different majors? It's vocal music, dance, drama, instrumental. So, it's four different majors. The school had like, eight, nine floors. It took up a whole block, it had like a basement."
"The rich histories that we have here. If you interview any of the elderly people you see walking down the street, they're going to give you a whole other side of it."
"When I was younger, I had very long hair, extremely long hair. You know, I just actually cut my hair like two weeks ago."
"It's been about a year. Um, yeah, like a year and some months, probably around four months or so. I haven't been keeping track."
"Oh, so basically, the type of skates with boots, do you have that type of skates? And where do you go skating with them?"
"Okay, cool. Um, I wanted to talk, also, with you about the schools you went to. So I know you went to RD-SCHOOL-4. Um,"
"Oh. If you could be a doctor, what do you think you would have to do?"
"No, children these days are more advanced. They are going to attend dances and have boyfriends."
I think it's more cool to be a weirdo now. Not so much back then though.
"No. She would- we were playing, um, with the little pony, My Little Pony, you know."
"There's a colored guy and a white guy, you know. They are bounty hunters, you know."
"Uh, just, you know, I think she just screams to hear herself scream, tell the truth."
"And, um, he woke up and it was a hundred years, and he was very old."
"I don't know. As long as you have something in your brains and everything, stay there."
She said I'm the second Simon and she's the first. So my cousin calls her Simon.
Atlanta music. I enjoy listening to your beats.

"Yes, he did, and my mother was married."
Then that's when all this crazy stuff started.
"Why, what is the difference in the bands?"
And my friends and I were all there.
And so what else? What else is happening?

And we used to do that a little.
We play music over there and have dances.

"Oh, what happened with Valley of the Dolls?"
"No, I don't know. I never said any."
"I need to take care of that, okay."
"No, he moved his body towards me, [at-]"
Yeah. Do you like horses? They're pretty good.
"Well, it's just a matter of having connections."
And they were evacuating people from the houses.
"She was happy to meet me. And, um, we- she and I, we never went anywhere. She was just here visiting, but he brought her there to meet me. And I always thought that he told his wife about me, but he didn't tell anybody else until I met /RD-NAME-1/. And I'm thinking, maybe he told /RD-NAME-1/ because he was too proud to tell me because he's from the old days in the South. You didn't socialize like that. And I think it would have been embarrassing to him for anybody to know that I was his child. So I never said anything, but all my life I had been told he was my father. But my mother"
"They started talking to each other and getting to know each other. And before them, I have a big sister, who is twenty-one. She also has a different father than I do. And then, going back to my dad, there are two more siblings, which my mom and my dad have. But he's our father."
"Even when I go to those areas, I still think, look at all these buildings and look at all these people. To me, it's like a mini New York. There are just so many people. It's like a shock, it's just crazy to me. Sometimes I ask the adults, I say, how do you all feel about how it looks now compared to when you all were younger? And they don't, nobody is amazed other than me. So I don't understand it. But they just, they just like, I think everybody else is still, still can't believe that they built all these buildings and how nice it looks, and the white people walking around like it's nothing."
"You know, so. I remember wanting to go. I went, when after that lady, after I saw that lady, man. I went home and cried. I went home and cried. And I wanted to like, Yeah. I felt helpless."
"Yes, I understand. However, it turned out that the guest, um, it ended up happening that they - they, that engagement went through as the girl had planned, and so on."
"Yeah. And they actually want to have the audacity to use somebody else, use, low-income people to help them fight their cause. Because they know their wealthy individuals won't help them."
"Well, my sister, that was my former teacher before I graduated from school. Her name was Miss [RD-NAME-2]. She was a really nice teacher. She took us on trips and such. She took us to the Capitol and, um, I forgot the other places, but we had a really good time in her classroom."
"After we finished our homework, we went for a bike ride. We had to be inside the house before it got dark outside."
"And so he got into trouble again, and he went to this church. And then, him and this big guy, they left together."
"I have seen millions of pictures of people at carnival, but I have never personally seen a guy in some type of costume."
"I went to school with people that I still see. I went to elementary school with them, and I still see these people."
"Oh no. They didn't come and stay in a hotel. They came to, um, do you know the grandmother, I mean aunt on-"
"A boy brought it to school. In sixth grade, we had lizards and everything else for a science project. I didn't like it. We had to take them out and cut them open. They were already dead. Ew."
"Like, if um, uh, um, she always has a um, this, it's uh, it's a heavy thing on her desk. It's made out of iron. Real heavy. We always take it and roll it under the table, and she asks where it's at? Nobody says anything. When the janitor comes in to sweep the floors, she finds it under there."
"Well, we decided on Bear because we knew that he was going to be large."
"And they don't even think about it, I'm bound to be great in something else."
"Alright, and go out. And she- Um, she has a boyfriend named /RD-NAME-2/, and um."
"Yeah, man. But the plot always involves a female, bro. If you ever noticed it."
The basketball stars are likely getting paid more than the theater stars in high school.
"I enjoy walking when I have the opportunity. Currently, I also have a stationary bicycle."
It's not even the entire story. I'm just sharing small snippets so we can proceed.
Please continue with your story. I was asking you to explain what vertical policing means.
"Um, food unites us. That's what I observed within our family, like, food and parties."
Y two G gang or something. It was like a lot of different names and-
"Yeah. Took the bus. Mm, yeah. It was. it was. it was a nice place."
"Yeah. Yeah. Is it a good thing, a bad thing? Do you think it's good?"
"I mean I could walk, but I would be exhausted by the time I arrive."
"Against a tree. And, so you run, and everybody hide and you go find them."
"Um, that was amazing. Yes, yes. That was an incredible success, and we have a"
"Huh? Oh yeah. I have some things at home now. Excuse me. Um, you know, like? There's a memorandum too, but I mean, just little sketches, you know, little jokes and things like that. Original, what I had, I figured it out myself. All nice and clean, no more messy stuff. You can say it anywhere, put it that way. You can say it in church. Now."
"whatever comes. I mean, there is no preference, because with poetry, it's so. it's infinite, you know what I'm saying, infinite possibilities on what type of poem you can make. So it's just like, you know, the poetry that rhymes, you know, some poetry is just literally you talking, through, you know, stream of consciousness. So you just saying things- you saying- you saying whatever- it- it may be- you may use poetic terms, like things like that to make it sound like an actual poem, but like"
"Um, the um, story I like best, when um, this girl named Jill came to town, and she brought this baby, and the um-, She claimed the baby was Allison's, but um, as the story goes on, it's proved that the baby is hers."
"So I went to school. Uh, I went to RD-SCHOOL-2 Elementary School in Walker Mill. Um, before that I went to RD-SCHOOL-6."
"Now, how does that work? Do Tarboro work full-time and, and, you help out Tarboro sometimes? Or does Tarboro come over here?"
"And so, they caught the big guy and he brought him back, showed them where Luke was. Luke was in the church."
"Yeah, I understand. You had two options. You had to choose one of the subjects in order to graduate from high school."
"Uh, I want to discuss some simple topics and, like, what types of games do you play in this area, for instance?"
"Okay. Well, I would like to try the macaroni and cheese next time you prepare it. I'll just taste it for you."
"More of a class thing. And it's like, even if you see African Americans who are moving over here now, they're totally disconnected to, like. Actually, dang, do I have it in my, I'm actually doing a paper myself on my program on the need for community centers in low-income areas."
"So, as he entered the location, to retrieve the diamonds, he descended through the ceiling. Then, the alarm sounded and they apprehended them inside, and they were planning to kill him. So, they simply abducted him, placed him in a vehicle, and drove away. They intended to dispose of him by throwing him over a cliff. However, he fought back and killed two of the men, disposed of their bodies by throwing them over the cliff, and took the car."
"I had the opportunity to interact and connect with different people. One significant experience I had in high school was my first job, which was as an assistant editor for the judiciary committee. Interestingly, I obtained this job through a connection from my high school. The House of Representatives contacted my high school and requested a recommendation for a top senior who could fill the position on Capitol Hill after graduating. High school played a crucial role in my career development. Um, I believe it was very influential. Can I stop? (whispered) Sorry, I had a momentary lapse in my thoughts, so I forgot what I wanted to say."
"Boy, they can drink a lot. But, I noticed that the people in the community were staring at us. We received some disapproving looks that made me feel uncomfortable."
"And this, um, I forget the other guy, hit a home run. , I can't think of his name, but I'm not very familiar with the players, you know."
"Yeah, well if he falls, no, not actually. The rope, if, if you trip, the rope, you know, falls or comes out of your hand or something, you know."
"Um, so we're all in Raleigh. Um, I'm actually from there where- well um, Ryan, the tall guy that was in here, he's from Detroit, and then Drew who had the camera, he went to school originally in Tennessee and his parents are in South Carolina. And Sarah, the other girl here, is from Iowa. So we're from all over, but this is my home."
"And uh, he was very courageous, and they- you know, so, one day he started- He um- him and this big guy got into a fight. This guy, uh, he could defeat everyone in the prison."
"And you know, and then, and then they tried, they tried to be civilized people again, cause they didn't want, they didn't want to get killed, so, the boy named T. W. his father, um, his father was, was um, mad at him."
"Uh, that's pretty good. Oh, [RD-NAME-2], could I ask you not to hang on to the microphone. You should hear some of the tape, cause it sounds like all the while cause the mic is so close to your hand. Okay, I know it turned the wrong way, but they can- I can still hear you when I listen. Okay, another question. Is it a bunch of kids that you always hang around with and do things with?"
"Okay, so let's see. You're saying that you grew up in the 1980s, right? So, when we talk about technology, what was your experience with it back then?"
"Well, my last day of work, of course, when I was promoted to Battalion Chief, the old, ugly race picture came up again in that situation, you see."
"Alright, um, do you have any questions for me and are you okay with me potentially using this recording for research?"
"Um, we had a group of people. If you found me, I would have to assist you in locating everyone else."
"Yeah. And I was even waiting, that was before in the middle, forget about that. When it was towards my career."
"Um, and I'm not a super detail-oriented person, I could probably never do events."
"Uh, no. I can't because I- I-, I believe I missed this last week."
"So there's a lot of things happening? Like, it's- is that a significant matter?"
Washington DC. <laugh> What does your dad do? What does he do for work?
You don't collect bottles and anything else. You fight with just your bare fists.
"My good friend, [RD-NAME-4], who was the president of the tenant association, at [RD-ADDRESS-8]."
"Have you ever had a favorite teacher? You know, throughout your time in school?"
"It doesn't fit, right? Not to say that they can't fix the area up."
Yep. He is like that. I try to leave him from time to time.
"I have watched many good movies, but you know, that was a good time."
"Okay. Okay, let's start again. So you were saying you live on a farm."
Do you currently reside with your grandmother?
"Um, it's been about eight months now."
"Of course, you can inform him. <laugh>"
What do you want it to be?
And so those are your two daughters?
She worked at a hospital. She did.
What about the black and brown? (whispered)
I'm not really enjoying myself here. Yeah.
"That's pretty cool, I really like it."
And we are still on the airwaves.
"Backyard, Rare Essence, EU, there's one more."
"Yeah, it's around eleven dollars per hour."
"Uh, yeah. I had one teacher. Uh"
Okay. And she taught at the RD-WORK-5.
"Oh, why does he yell at you?"
"So we call ourselves blood cousins, sisters."
"After you hosted the kindergarten program, right."
They begin at First Street and continue.
"So, yeah, you saw him and came."
"Yes, they are called the Candy Cane."
"Oh, that probably made it worse. (laughs)"
This is what I was telling [RD-NAME-2].
"Yes, Um, how did you play marbles?"
"Oh, okay, let's talk about mumbo sauce."
"Um, and what does your mom do?"
"And then, they went into the cafeteria."
"Honestly, I feel like in this generation,"
Who are you related to in Princeville?
Is that- are those the most common?
But now we have new people arriving.
I began singing in a church choir.
"Yeah, what did you study and everything?"
That's what we were discussing. The Canadians.
So you've lived here your whole life?
"Yes, How do you earn a point?"
When did you get your first car?
"It's okay. Yeah, it's okay, you know."
"Um, it was like, it gave me an opportunity to learn about different colleges because I didn't know there was a college named NYU. I didn't know there was a college named Medgar Evers. I didn't know there was a college, um, Temple. I knew Temple but I didn't know about all the other colleges we visited, like Sarah Lawrence. I didn't know that was a college. Um, it just gave me an opportunity to experience college life and, um, it gave me a chance to really connect with some people because before I went on the college tour, I didn't really talk to anybody. But now that I- I used to talk to people but they weren't the ones who went on the"
"I guess it's because there's something about the person who plays the part of Granny on the show. I think she's a wonderful person, but everybody on the Hill- uh Beverly Hillbillies to me is a wonderful actor, and I really enjoy that. I see it almost everyday because I'm here when it comes on."
"You know what I'm saying. We are fishing for the people we want to involve ourselves with, and we may get their competitors. We may be fishing for one type of person, and their competitors might contact us. And the people we actually fish for, we may not even get them, and that's okay. (laughter)"
"Four corners is when you draw the four corners and play in the four corners. In kickball, you choose a team and one team is out on the field, one's back kicking, running to the first, second, third base, and home."
"Okay. Yeah, the neighborhood is like one big family wherein everyone interacted with each other as far as child rearing. When it goes back to ""it takes a village, "" it really was a village because if you saw your neighbor's trash out, you would take their trashcan around back for them. Or if you saw a neighbor bringing groceries from the car, you would help that person. And it was just like second nature that we did those things for each other. So growing up in that neighborhood taught me a sense of family and community. We have very strong roots."
"I wasn't actually playing cards. This boy was teaching me how to play a game. Then a girl told her, and she started getting angry with me."
"Well, I was returning from my high school reunion. And, I was approximately thirty to forty minutes away from Valdosta. And, I ended up getting sandwiched in."
"When you attend medical school, you are unable to work. It's just not possible. However, some individuals have managed to do it, but I personally don't think I could have because I was working from four to twelve. I don't believe I could have done that successfully."
"So, let me ask you a couple of different questions based on that. Thinking about, have you lived anywhere else outside of Congress Heights but you've traveled to other neighborhoods and then you've gone to. So tell me, what do you see that's different from where you live versus some of the other neighborhoods? Do you see a difference? Are you allowed to go into other neighborhoods?"
Hmm. Okay. Did the children in your class ever play a prank on a teacher when you were in class?
"I wasn't a lifeguard because I couldn't swim. But I was there to assist girls in the shower, you know."
"At my school, every class is entertaining. And, um, I enjoy all of my teachers except for one. She- Mm."
"Anything can be good? Right? So basically, if I'm listening to rock and roll, and it sounds good, it's great."
"Mm, see, and that's when I'm like, you should buy me a store or something like that. A clothing store."
"Um, in ninth grade, and then, like, probably the last quarter of tenth grade, I moved. That's when we moved."
"Uh, my first grade teacher. I liked her. She really pushed me. You know, I did get held back one grade, but she was my second year, first grade teacher I had, and out of all of the kids, she was more focused on me. So, to this day, we still talk. [laughter]"
"Whichever college I really want to attend a school that offers my major. Or one of the majors that is considered top. But I guess what I want more is to sit down with my family, narrow down my choices based on what I feel capable of and what they feel capable of."
"And she said, and then, a girl named [RD-NAME-2] she said, let's play reform school, so the girl named [RD-NAME-2] said, okay. You know she had to be the leader cause she's older."
"Yeah. So, since I still went to school up here, I always end up spending the night at my grandma's house or going back and forth. So, when they officially got everything from Florida, I was still at my grandma's house. And I just kind of- uh, we just stayed there, like me and my mom stayed there. And then my mom, she went on the road with my dad. So, from what I remember, it was really me and my grandma from when I was six, seven, eight years old."
"Um, I suppose, like, when my brother was born, he used to go to this nightclub called Faces frequently. Do you know its location? I believe it's on Georgia Avenue, which isn't very informative. I can't, uh, yeah. (laughs)"
"You come right off the bridge, I sort of live in that area. Do you know where the American Buffet is, where those car dealerships are?"
"Uh, she was one of our members. I grew up with her children."
"We stayed there for a few weeks, and then we traveled to Texas."
"Yeah, I'm like, I need. I need people. I need community. Definitely community."
"Okay, well, um, when was the last time you had some barbecue sauce?"
"I thought you went. Okay, I kept thinking you were near Raleigh. Okay."
"Oh, yes. Okay. Um, do you have a teacher who yells a lot?"
"That must have been difficult, playing all these games if you had asthma."
"And they were, were they sharecroppers or did they have their own farm?"
"And if we play basketball, you know, toss it up in the air,"
"I'm going to lean over or something. Just lean back. Seriously, I'm fine."
"So when we left there, after that service, we went to another mall."
All of us are twenty four. I'm twenty three. RD-NAME-2 is twenty two.
"Hmm, what do the kids do when school gets out? Around your neighborhood."
"I understand. Alright, um, what type of television programs do you enjoy watching?"
"""That's where they had been to check if anyone was inside or. """
"Like, for example, okay, I work at RD-WORK-2. And, I don't, I talk to a lot of customers and stuff, and they see me all the time, and I always ask them, hey, where are you all from? And a lot of them say, oh, I'm not from here, I'm from somewhere else. Or, there's just a lot of that. Like I do, well, nowadays, sometimes, it's, unless I know them already, but, a lot of times, it's hard to find people that I just meet that are from here."
"It was enough of a gap that he did his own things, and then he left the house. I was still in school, so it felt like I was the only child."
"No. Because it's not, it's not for no reason why. I just mean that, that never was me, never was. I wasn't the type of person like a few of my other friends. I don't have to go all the way over to travel or to learn. I can do all of that here. And while later on in life when I have money of my own, I can go out and explore and travel and see new cities. I've been to every state on the east coast. So it's nothing new. I've traveled places."
"Yeah, and they're taking back the nation's capital. Um, and it's because when my father was a child, you know, there was a carefree atmosphere. Like, that was when DC started to flourish when he was a child."
"Um, I only remember that one time when my friends were following, um, what's his name? Master P's son?"
"Oh, that's nice. What do you want to be when you graduate, [RD-NAME-2]? Have you ever thought about that?"
"But, it didn't help, Independence Plaza. That was purchased for one hundred and fifty million. You know, Independence, yes."
"I happened to finish work early that day, so, you know, we came and took the truck down there."
"It just almost feels like African drums. Like it just touches your soul. I can't really explain it, it's something you have to experience. And once you experience it, you'll understand."
"Oh lord. You're going to be getting into enough fights. Um, so, the other question I want to ask you is - Okay so, now that we've left middle school, did the teacher have a really. letter?"
"And so, they're a group- uh- I met one named, /RD-NAME-3/. One named /RD-NAME-2/ and, and all those girls. They're nice too. I mean, you don't have to be, you know, all- You don't have to be all white, all Negro, to have good friends. I mean, there are some bad white people in the world just like there are bad Negros. But you know, some people- some, white people are pretty neat. I mean, they ain't bad at all."
"Um, I believe I speak loudly enough, so I'm going to actually give you my microphone. So /RD-NAME-2/ will do most of the talking, but if you want to chime in, he might want you to add some details. Is that alright?"
"they informed me about how they had to work in the fields, and my mother also mentioned to me at one point that they had to- There were some individuals who were traveling from the city."
"I'm fine. So even now, getting the car, it's not good for me. I'm talking about if a bus is coming right here, I'm holding on to the rail. I'm really shaken up. It's really bad."
"She died in 2009. How were you - were you with her when she died? Or were you at school? Like, were you -"
"They are behaving in a slightly unruly manner, so, yes. However, I believe she should earn a significant amount more, but that's her job."
You won't see any African Americans or Hispanics. I've noticed that in all the bars they've built. You know how many bars we have.
"You know, instead of paying attention to them and taking a picture. Oh and I also met Shaq, but he's not from here, so."
"Oh yeah? And what, can you remember a funny story from the Flintstones? Can you remember a funny episode that you can tell me?"
Have you been to DC before? I remember coming to DC when I was eleven and we visited the monuments and all the museums.
"Uh, let's see. When you get to take out your takeout, you have- But- but Maryland- Maryland, M-"
"So, it was like, no, I just have to go around it. Yeah. Go around the obstacles, don't"
"Okay, so, good, you went into details about the men. What do you think people think about women?"
"Yes, but those were the only ways that she had any difficulty."
"I was at Le Pearl, the Mad Chef. It's a large restaurant."
"Up until February of the following year, the flood occurred in September."
Good. What did you study back in elementary school? Do you remember?
"Miami Beach, that's correct. I was chauffeuring all of them years ago."
"Yeah, I went to the Pythodd, but I was an adult then."
"And every time it starts smoking, they go back out there again."
But they - they didn't say why he did it or anything?
"Oh, I never started it. I don't really engage with that stuff."
"Okay, what other things do you do besides kickball, rope, and house?"
"But it's like I said, I don't see him as my stepdad."
"Well, I played Hopscotch, Double Dutch, tag, and Hide and Go Seek."
Those are the ones you recall?
It's on RD-ADDRESS-7. And that th-.
"They're growing fast these days, huh?"
"I understand. ""Sclusy"" means essentially exclusive."
Oh. How do you spell it?
I didn't hear anything about Princeville.
The most recent boat that arrived.
"Yeah, we had about fifteen dogs."
"Well, then let's discuss your grandparents."
"I don't really like football, but."
"Yeah, I apologize, that's truly unfortunate."
So this should be quite interesting.
I attended three different elementary schools.
Your stepfather served in the military.
Did you meet this guy there?
Al Gore spoke at our graduation.
Yeah. Everybody always listens to her.
"You have the backyards, right. Okay."
Where did you stay in Tarboro?
"You're too cool for that, right?"
"Yeah, it was my aunt. Yep."
"Okay, what sports did you play?"
Was that for every Seventh grade?
He worked with that child. What?
It's only really one school. Exactly.
"No, I don't have any children."
He was very understanding about it.
"Man, there's something wrong with that."
"Yes, were your team members skilled?"
It's really funny. It truly is.
Two people were on the ends.
"Yeah, same neighborhood as my mother."
Keep my house tidy and organized.
Have you ever seen them perform?
"you mean specifically, New York culture."
Yes. Which school do you attend?
"Okay, great. That's the first part."
"Yeah, I remember it. I remember."
Everybody has great things to say.
"A little, I don't, old, younger."
I trust you. I trust you.
"Then, where is Church Street located?"
"Well, I used to play Knucks."
"Yes. Um, how old are you?"
"Yes, that's where I was born."
"Man, that's really what's happening online."
"Oh, okay. I was thinking, oh."
Okay. And so they also had
Yeah. The Cowboys and Indians. [laughter]
"Okay, cool. So, as I mentioned, it's more formal than it seems. I just want to know your perception of Rochester, what it was like for you growing up here, where you attended school, and what your future plans are. These questions are open-ended, so you can answer them in different ways."
"Well, even though I was always a really good hair stylist, I was more involved in conversations than anything. I would lean on the clients and crack jokes. I'm always so funny. It was just something to keep me from being idle at home. You know, I wasn't really invested, I guess."
"What do I do? On Christmas, my mother will give me toys. I just play as if I want something, then I just get it and play with it, if it's something to play with. If it's something to wear, I wear it and go somewhere. And on Thanksgiving, all we do is that my mother prepares food and we eat. On Easter, we get our Easter clothes and we go to church. On Easter Monday, we go out somewhere like Marshall Hall or somewhere similar."
"I would be fine, you know what I mean. Like I would be surviving because I pass all my tests when I show up and take them. They're like, how did you do this? You haven't been here all week."
"Before I started playing Overwatch, which was in September, I made my Xbox Live account. That's when I started playing Overwatch. But before that, the only thing you would see in my Xbox was Lego games. And that too was another stress reliever because Lego games are just fun. They're adorable, funny, and you can't get mad at a Lego game. I've played all the Star Wars Lego games, the Harry Potter Lego games, and I'm currently playing through all the superhero Lego games. I just beat the Marvel one, and I'm currently beating Lego Batman three."
Okay. Great. We can begin by discussing where you grew up in Rochester or the surrounding area.
"Well, um, what's true is I suppose the role you have in whatever it is, you know."
"And, um, oh, what's that guy that, he's in the, uh, [inaudible], what was that? Can't think."
I wouldn't think that. Now you sort of take care of all your older brothers and sisters?
"Well, I've been extremely ill to the point where I wish I could, you know, pass away."
". ""Inaudible"". Okay, how about in school, did you ever have a teacher who yelled a lot?"
Yeah. We lived like not too far away from the school. I don't remember the exact address.
. - your medication and things like that. You were still able to run around and play.
"Yes, I had a friend of mine around last year. Her name was Ira. She was Spanish."
"And, I really think that those negative things spill into our everyday lives. The way services are allocated and, and in the way even, money's appropriated to them on our government levels. The way police come into our community, the way policies are written, these things spill, these things stigmatizations spill into our realities. And make it harder for us to live."
"And they went. And when they went, I guess like. Okay, it all started because one of my friends threw a beer in the fire. And the dude didn't want him to throw the beer into the fire, I guess. And then, he started talking all types of mad trash. And the next thing you know, he um, he hit my friend. Then my friend was about to retaliate, and then my other friend came by to try to stop him. And then, after that, the one that tried to stop him got hit. And then next thing you have, four people, ready to fight. Now, those four people are going to turn into eight or nine people."
"Like, you know, if you step on the line, you'll be out. Also, if your rock goes off the number you put in on, you'll be out too."
"Well, this happened a few years ago. I was on a trapeze. I was really good at it. Um, and I was swinging one day with my whole family watching. It was a big circus day. I was swinging along, and then I fell. I could feel myself falling and."
"They went to Randolph Street. My grandmother still has a house off Randolph Street. So when I was born, we lived on Jefferson Street for two years. I don't recall any of that. I just remember moving to Southeast when I was three years old. So we grew up since we were three years old. When I was twelve, that's when they tore down the neighborhood."
"Well, a brick mason, most of the time, you don't find him on a lower level of the ground, you see. Most of the time he's always on top, watching his men and things. Leveling all the time, you know. See if things level and see if the walls level, see if the floor level."
"Yes. , So you enjoy teachers who, who throw parties for you huh? Uh-huh. Who was the worst teacher you ever had?"
"Yes. RD-NAME-3 was a little, maybe a couple of years older than RD-NAME-3 was. So, yep, it was a very sad time."
"You know. And that's, I'm usually with him, sometimes you know-"
I don't think I should have stayed here for this long.
The Gators used to definitely win a couple of those things.
I'm happy when they win. Alabama University wins those football games.
"Do you play? Oh, tell me about your dances and things."
"Yeah, other than that. Okay, um, did you play May I?"
"But then, it'll eventually, yeah, they will catch on. Pause. Yeah."
"Okay. And then east of that, like First Avenue, Second Avenue."
"It's totally different from hip hop. In hip hop, they mainly talk about selling drugs and smoking weed. I mean, I like the sound of it, but not all the time. When it comes to go go music, I usually enjoy Chuck Brown or something similar. Run Joe, for example, is a great song."
"Challenge. So, what? Okay. So, let's. let's back up. Now, thinking about, we're in the south, and we're black, and you had a lot of white friends."
"Let me ask you. In your opinion, what do you think the boundaries are of the Lower East Side as a neighborhood? In terms of the streets, people have different opinions about that. What's the Lower East Side to you? Like the geographic"
"I think, um, because when I got there in the sixth grade, I was having a hard time just because I was used to public school. So this private school was a lot harder and I had never been to a predominantly white school before. So I was struggling, but eventually I figured it out and I became pretty popular, I guess, and had a lot of friends. So I guess they just wanted a black girl that would be silent and follow all the rules. I don't really know how to explain it. But that's the best that I can do."
"I enjoy science. I believe I developed an interest in science when I was in junior high school because I had a teacher who was very supportive. And I was achieving good grades. I thought to myself, you know what? I actually enjoy this. I'm doing well academically."
"Hmm, let me think. And um, we played football. Do you know how to play football?"
"I'm on a bus. No, they don't let freshmen have cars. You can have cars but-"
I suppose if he just comes and hangs out with the guys who are with us.
I think I remember playing that in school. How do you describe how you play volleyball?
Have you ever had a teacher that you really couldn't stand because they were really gripey?
"I remember your dad was talking, but I didn't know who. He didn't mention any names."
"Mm. Yes. Oh, that sounds like a good one. Do you have a pet at home?"
"Just have to grab it. You know. Because, there's really no excuse, I mean. Other than, everybody's upbringings may be a little different, but everybody had the same chance that you have. Some may have a better chance because their parents may be a little well off, or may have had the extra means, but I wouldn't let that deter you from reaching your goals just because of that."
"And then, um, I wasn't really interested in cheerleading because I feel like I'm a leader, and the things they were doing to the people who were auditioning, it was like some kind of sorority. I knew I wouldn't pass that test."
"So everybody, worked together and I cannot express enough how grateful I am for the volunteers that came from West Virginia."
"He began on Ormond Street and had a restaurant downstairs. Everyone lived above something. My friend [RD-NAME-1], who I consider as a sister, lived above him. He made and sold chicken sandwiches and coffee royal. Coffee royal was a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey in it, which was illegal."
"Well, if we chase a person and if we catch them, we take them. Throw them, make it seem like we're going to the trash can."
"So, how far have you progressed in the process of writing your book? Because I know you have the names figured out. I noticed you have"
"Because I saw, like on Avenue D, it's all torn down. Avenue D is like the place that used to be the center of violence for the Lower East Side. Okay?"
"Until one day, I realized that some drug addicts had moved into my building in Harlem. And they weren't typical drug addicts, they were very sociable. Next thing I knew, they had robbed my apartment and taken everything from it. And they entered through the ceiling."
"They are so focused on this thing because it's popular, football and sports are popular. It's going to help me get a scholarship or something."
Evicting people from their homes without providing them with alternative housing. We will demolish this on the specified date. Leave.
"Oh, he wasn't potty trained. My mother had just bought a new rug and he ended up peeing on it."
"When you've had trouble, you said, when you're talking about food, do you enjoy it? Like, what is your profession?"
"Um, Hopscotch, and, uh, what was it? , Chinese Jump Rope, with the rubber bands."
"If I really want to play it with my boyfriend or my friends or whatever,"
"That day, I was actually going to my interview, and I was at a job."
"Because you're supposed to have manners. You say, ""May I? "" Thank you and please."
"Yes. But when I was growing up, it was like Most Wanted, Shut 'Em Down."
"That's such a big deal? Okay. That's interesting. I'm sorry, I didn't realize that. Um,"
Everybody has them like their motherfucking license plates or something.
"Uh, if someone sneezes or coughs, they have a cold."
"I support Venus, and uh, Serena is definitely, you know."
Think of some other things that are unique to DC?
And then I had a cat. Her name was Queenie.
"Oh, I see. That's how the older children do it."
I'm just sitting here and I can see the classroom.
How long does it take to become a dental hygienist?
"You know, I still see her. You know, like we."
"Even at my graduation, which happened during a difficult time."
"Hmm, well, let me think. Which school do you attend?"
"Yes, have you ever had a teacher who yelled frequently?"
"No, no, no. Uh- but this is- This is great."
"Oh, I've loved steam engines since I was a kid."
How have you been? Have you attended college or. ?
"I rarely watch Another World, but I do enjoy it."
"Oh, into the sixth. Well, which school did you attend?"
"So that was, once it rolls over there, now how"
"You were involved in it, and I take that seriously."
I heard of him. How do you spell his name?
You know. You know how kids can do different things.
"Like, it's just so, amazing. When I was really young,"
We have a large fence.
You were born in DC.
Did I get yelled at?
But. This is the thing.
What was wrong with her?
I have heard a few.
Which school did you attend?
There were many of them.
She doesn't have any children.
I know who he is.
Tell me her name again.
Will the housing be affordable?
You know what I mean.
"Mm. , Cut those ties."
"Well, that's how I feel."
I know how it goes.
"I should wait, right? [laughs]"
He danced for the Mystics.
But her dad had different
Oh. Tell me about that.
"Memorial Drive was crowded, and"
Should I have said that?
"The little si- uh, Lakeside."
the place to hang out.
We play in the trees.
"Yeah. Yeah, that's correct. Mm-hm."
She was 103 years old.
"Yes, how old are you?"
Did he do anything amusing?
"Man, you're talented at that!"
Did you represent your neighborhood?
I'm telling you the truth.
We set up that night.
How do you accomplish that?
Stealing something from a store.
"Yeah. But um, that's, yeah."
Does it ever behave strangely?
It was busier back then.
Do you use that word?
Did you enjoy yourself there?
"Um, I forgot the word."
It's a first person shooter.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. <laugh>
Tell me about your grandparents.
"Yeah, aren't you from Alabama?"
What is a ten fifty?
The Our Lives Matter bus?
"Oh, it was one time."
Which night does it air?
Rock with the cool stuff.
One boy and three girls.
"I pick up one child on one weekend and pick up the other child on the next weekend. The reason why I don't pick them up together is because I can't handle both of them together. My younger child, she's tough by herself. Eventually, when they get older, I will get both of them together. I pick up my youngest daughter every Wednesday. But I see my oldest daughter frequently. I see her mostly throughout the week. So, basically, throughout the week, I'm probably by myself once a week."
"I have a dog and a cat. My cat has some kittens, and we kept one. And so, our dog had some puppies, and he still has some. And, we sometimes our cat gets in our bed, gets in my bed, in my brother's bed, and sleeps with us, and our dog does too."
"I have to be at school by the quarter to nine o'clock bell ring, and we have to be at school before nine o'clock. And when the girl calls roll, if you come in after nine o'clock, you're late."
"Yeah. I was actually talking to one of my good friends, um, well actually a childhood friend who, you know, a couple weeks ago. And he just, you know, we were talking about how we used to play kickball in the backyard, and, you know, play all different make up games, and you know, play all different types of espionage, you know, manhunt games we used to have. And it was like, wow."
"So, that's just why it is. You know, some people in certain parts of North Carolina and everywhere else, it's just that the majority hasn't embraced it. Like, older people don't want to hear it because they think it's just noise and commotion. Older people from different areas can't relate to it, just like we can't relate to house music because we're not from Baltimore. You know what I mean? So we listen to that music, and there might be certain songs that we like, like, ""okay, I can vibe with this, "" but as a whole genre, we can't really connect with it. We don't want to hear that music. So I wouldn't expect anyone else to want to"
"Well, I did everything. I bought and sold. I went shopping. Yeah, I went to the market. Used to get up at five o'clock and go to the market, get my supplies. Come back and put them up. And then prepared my food for the day, you see?"
"Um, what else do you remember about the block or the neighborhood at the time that you were growing up? What was it like?"
"I met you when I saw you the other day, and it seemed like you were heading somewhere, right?"
"That's why I spend a lot of time alone. When you socialize, it makes you vulnerable to others. And that's the one thing about kids, around thirteen, fourteen, or maybe fifteen. Some of them might even be seventeen. I can feel more comfortable and open with them because I pretty much understand where they're coming from. I know their struggles and stresses. And if I don't have the answers or can't help them, I feel like there are various resources available within the school and the community that can assist them and their families."
"Rare Essence is a very well-known go-go band. They have had some commercial success, although not as much as Chuck Brown. He has been the biggest crossover act in that genre. However, Rare Essence is what I would consider mature and sophisticated."
"In countries and different cultures, why do people speak differently and wear different clothes?"
I enjoy learning through various experiences and having a different experience every day. So-
"Alright. Okay. Okay, so, like, do you hear people calling people Mo and Bob?"
"If you wore contact lenses, and, um, automatically money comes to you, you know?"
"Well, that sounds very interesting. Um, what things did you study this past year?"
They were talking about Attorney Street. It's around the corner from here. That building.
"And, and young, when I was really, you know, I wasn't a singer now."
"There's a boutique that sells expensive shirts, like around two hundred dollars or so."
"He was a nice man, but Patty, who had been a movie star, you know, she just completely fell apart. She didn't pay any attention to him. So one day Patty Duke came home, and he was in the swimming pool with this girl. And the girl was naked. Patty Duke was on the balcony. And the girl saw Patty Duke coming, and she jumped out the swimming pool and ran around the corner. And Patty Duke started crying. And she ran to the studio looking for her director. Because she was in love with him. And she was looking for him, and the director is out with Betty. The director and Betty were together."
"But that's why they didn't want you specifically. So I went to the Armstrong School to learn a trade. Now, um, like History, and I forget now. Many things. I'll tell you some of the things, but it may be further back than you would prefer."
"I like that. And I like the fact that he's willing to fight for what he wants, even though he's not going about it the right way. So yeah. I see myself in Ghost a little bit. That's why I like."
"And, the block isn't the same, you know, everybody's not. She doesn't know everybody walking down the street, and then if she does she just met them."
"I was just scared because there are too many woods, trees, and places to bury people out here."
"And then, they count up to one hundred, and after they finish counting, they would try to find."
"Mm. Let's see now. He would be tall. Tall and, you know, a little older than I am."
"Mm-hm. Oh well, that's very interesting. Um, okay let's talk about, uh, TV programs. Do you watch television?"
"Well, our goal was, uh, in the end, a boy and a girl were always in the ring."
I would give the remaining portion to my grandmother.
She's just like the one in the second grade.
What time in the afternoon do you finish school?
But it sounds like you handled it very well.
"And, um, you would be considered the middle child?"
"In Brooklyn. So, yeah that's what they did and-"
I just enjoy going to the movies and eating.
"If I had known, I wouldn't have checked, right?"
"Cause, uh, they're always with me all the time."
"Um, somewhere in Maryland. Somewhere near La Plata, Maryland."
"Oh, okay, so you want me to explain that."
"Yeah. Almost half of my life, you know, like-"
"Uh, do you like to play games where you-"
"No. Okay, tell me about the school you attend."
"No, no. That's what I want you to discuss."
"Hmm. Yes and no. Because I believe that many of the people who are moving in now, I suppose they believe they're beginning anew. It's like they're starting over for themselves."
"So, I know a lot of people who like the Divine Nine, but for me, when it came time for me to choose which sorority I wanted to join, Gamma Phi Delta was the organization that was most active on campus and in the community. So, it wasn't about the name, but about their actual impact. When I became a member of Gamma Phi Delta, our line consisted of twelve people, which was the largest number in a while because others weren't really involved in other activities. Once I became a member, everyone wanted to be in Gamma. Then I became the president of the sorority and so on. That's who was leading the way until I graduated. So."
"Mm. Yeah, but we had someone here, and he was helping his friends. So, I thought to myself, well, that's that guy."
"I think that's recreational. Right? So in your mind, that's something completely different. But in a car. But you don't mind flying?"
Some nurses give children their shots. Some nurses look in on patients and give them their breakfasts. They take their temperature and write on their record.
"Oh yeah. One potato, two potato, three potatoes, four. And then when we get to four, we are supposed to put our hand behind our back."
"No, that's not true. Have you ever seen Menace to Society? That movie was sad. O-Dog went to jail. Caine got killed. Uh, Sharif got killed."
"I think so. But tell me, maybe the rules are different, tell me."
"First of all, what kind of games do you play? Say after school."
"So yeah. But yeah, based on what we know about the family members,"
"Like, what specifically? Is there something that really hurts you that you see?"
"During that period, it started in seventh grade and continued until twelfth grade."
"North Carolina is slow. I'm like, it is, you know, it's not like."
"Going in there, it was like, okay, hey, I want to go get this. And it's crazy because I usually don't get ID'd, but I was like, hey, your ID."
"Jody is the girl, and Buffy, no, Jody is the boy, and Buffy is the girl. And then they have another big sister, and I think I forgot her name."
"Like the main ones, on my mom's side. It's like. shit. I don't know, bro. The- it's a lot. Cause now people are having kids, bro. I really can't. (laughing)"
"You can't just ignore that, you know. But, that's why I've always had problems with my hair."
I think it sounds nasally. And I also feel like many people originate from the city here.
"No, um- They call it Hillcrest. It's not really a neighborhood. It's more for older retired people."
"I mean, when I was growing up, when I was young, around fourteen or seventeen years old,"
"In all of your youth, up until the age of eighteen, what do you consider to be your best memory? Something that you remember and it brings you joy and warms your heart when you think about it."
"Cause, I told you, I lived in Brooklyn. In the Bronx, it's like, even coming back from Brooklyn, when I was"
"Yeah, I want to do clinical research about different mental illnesses. And like, I want to conduct clinical trials. But recently, I've been having a change of heart because I listened to this podcast, I think it's called like Codeswitch? NPR. Yeah. And they did one about cognitive behavioral therapy with this group of boys in Chicago and how going to these therapy sessions was helping them deal with their aggression and it was decreasing the number of fights and gang violence in Chicago. And I just think that would also be really interesting to do. Just because it's all about impulse control and why people do the things they do and also showing people that there are healthier outlets to express themselves instead of just immediately jumping to being aggressive. So I'm"
"And uh, at the end, usually the person who they said had done it, they see that they haven't cause, they shoot at one of the invaders, and they dissolve. It's usually three of them. Three men."
"So, um, a joke that we tell with our mother is like, we stay in a place for four years. That's basically what we do. So I've lived in all regions of the Washington area, Washington DC."
"School, school. You had to teach. Always teaching somebody something. So, she's teaching people how to build. That sort of thing. Anybody comes through the door, blocks. So that's the same thing, but just different interests, but the persistence is there."
"Anyway, uh, I thought my life was pretty good. I mean, I was in college at RD-SCHOOL-2. I had my boys in school, I had my grants all lined up, and everything was fine. I was doing well in school too."
"A lot of times, yeah. And so the asthma would be the gateway. Where, you know, I'll get the respiratory, you know, my breathing would be heavy and I'll get sick from that. But then I'll be exposed to so many other different types of germs and all that because my immune system was having a hard time fighting off just the asthma. So, I was always acceptable of getting, you know, catching a cold or some type of pneumonia. And a lot of the times I would have asthma."
"Okay. So if you go to the original post, there are hundreds of comments on there. It was good to see people posting funny stuff and trying to get down to the root of stereotypes and things like that. But I think that when we start genuinely understanding each other and not assume we know each other."
"Um, it had its ups and downs. It was a positive experience because most people in those housing projects had been living there for a long time. I was the youngest resident, so I was like the little baby that everyone tried to play with and take care of. We all felt like one big family. However, there were also individuals involved in street activities who lived in the projects. When conflicts arose among them, things could get dangerous. But as a child, I didn't really understand the concept of danger. It wasn't until I got older that I realized our housing project was actually a dangerous place. However, as kids, we thought it was amazing. I had my own little electric monster truck, which was really cool."
"That's correct. So, it's not that you can't give me advice, but if I'm sharing my experiences and I notice that you're going down the same path, sometimes it's better to keep some things to myself and share others. That way, you might not have to experience the same things I did."
"And, uh, you know, like I always say, I always like to see people who are in the right. I don't like to see anybody punished for something they didn't really do."
"Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. Um, I wanted to ask, okay so if modeling is not your long-term plan, what do you see for yourself in terms of the ultimate career or careers?"
"Mm-hm. So, how do you, um, decide which one is going to be on the team or anything like that? How do you think you have teams? You said you have teams."
"Sometimes, no matter how you handle something, you end up with scars, cuts, and similar injuries. In my opinion, that particular job should pay a higher salary regardless."
"Yeah. Very, yeah. So I stayed connected. And um. Yeah, we'd come down. We'd come down here. And we'd enjoy ourselves at these small bars and similar places."
"Yes, what other types of games do you play with children in the neighborhood when you don't have a ball or anything like that?"
The lady told the bus driver to have a good day. And she turned around and threw urine on her.
"Do you see that often, like, do you see that happening frequently in your neighborhood or even just in general?"
"No, not exactly. Just a regular car, not a messed up car but a nice car."
"I was there until my dad's health failed, approximately around seven years. Then I returned home."
"And my mom said, yes, we have insurance and everything. Yup. Wow."
"Yeah. I absolutely agree. It's a job. It's, uh, a legitimate job."
"Um, there is a strong sense of energy in the air currently."
Was it fair or do you think she was picking on you?
"Sometimes we, um, count by ones and, sometimes we count by tens."
He really motivated us to be good people.
We didn't return to school until October 4th.
"Boy, what would you do in California? Hm?"
I learned how to work as a bricklayer.
Right. Yeah. Especially at the University of Rochester.
"Oh, really? Was there a store there before?"
"I bathe him, and wow, he's really wild."
"Yeah, so, um, should I tell you why?"
Power is definitely one of my favorite shows.
"I attended Eastern, and it's a large school."
I show you guys off all the time.
So every day I drive by Shrimp Boat.
For a long time.
Working in city politics.
"Oh, um, yeah, Dalmatian."
"""That's right there. """
All four of us.
Is the church large?
How deep is it?
Two thousand and eight.
Where did they go?
It's not very strict.
"Oh, alright, alright, alright."
"Yes, everyone has smartphones."
"Oh. Oh, I remember."
It was for charity.
I made a mistake.
"It never happened, but-"
Not on the street.
No. I don't know.
Tell me a joke.
Okay. Just past the-
Do you like sports?
"Which, um, so, [laughter]."
Nobody says that anymore.
Something similar to that.
"Um, mine was theater."
Please wear the pants.
How old were you?
"Um, another one is-"
What does that mean?
I don't recall anything.
You don't help much?
"Yeah, I completely understand."
You were nervous. [laughter]
You don't pick teams.
Where did you go?
"Everybody, that is okay."
<laugh> There you go.
"Man, that's eighty dollars."
Eleven dollars an hour?
Not a good thing.
That's cool as well.
"It's like a lot of things happening. So they say, oh I'm not trying to be in that predicament. Or it's like, if there's a group of black kids walking down Eighth Street, it's all white people. They're gonna feel like this is not even their city anymore. They're gonna feel new. There's gonna be something about their environment that makes them want to do something stupid like, ""Oh, let's rob him because he has the new iPhone. "" That's how it is, that's why I say black teens fear white people. Because I think they're jealous of their not success but they're more successful than them."
"So I, um, because I don't like to say I graduated early, but I was put up a grade, so I graduated younger than my class age. And, um, like I said, I had my mother was always on drugs or incarcerated, and so I had a lot of things that were barriers. And because I was not a- I didn't make a lot of noise, sometimes you get pushed in the corner. And so although I did well academically, I had a guidance counselor who wasn't really engaged. And at that time I didn't know people. I didn't have friends whose families had gone on to college and, you know, people like, oh you're really smart and all. But there was"
"No. No. I don't think so. There are many people out here with government jobs who are doing things and such, and they don't have a college degree. I believe that going to school now is the right thing to do. However, you can still achieve something without going to school. That's just my personal opinion, but personally, I would go to school to be successful because that's what I want to do. But you don't have to go out, there are plenty of things you can do, plenty of programs you can start, and plenty of gadgets you can mess with."
"I think, I can only talk for myself, but I'm obsessed with all things hair and like eyebrows and stuff like that. And so I've been watching them since season one, they came a long way. And I just like seeing them as a family getting that money together. That motivated me and, um, just the way they look. I think it's a thing about looks because, with girls, like, I know when I was little, I had thousands of Barbie dolls. But, to you, they might all look the same, and to me they didn't look the same. So I think that's our obsession with like the Kardashians like, they- yeah, people might think like they're fake or whatever. But"
"I was all over that. So you know what I'm saying, I go in there and I, uh, these girls wanted me to sit by them, it's like some upperclassmen girls. They were juniors and stuff. It's my sophomore year. But at this point, you know what I'm saying, due to the trouble I got into at my private school, they had suspended me indefinitely. It was like, they didn't tell me how long I was suspended. They just said don't come back to school until we sort things out. I was all, okay cool, you know what I'm saying. And, uh, my mom, like she knew they were gonna end up expelling me, so she just"
"Yeah, I laughed to get the promotion for Captain. You see what they did, the fire department, with its segregated policies, adopted a retroactive ruling into its rules and regulations, forbidding me to take the examination for a Captain. I say retroactive because I had to complete a requirement of five years in the position as a Lieutenant, which was three years more than the white individuals had to do."
"Yeah. That's what I was thinking. I was like, hmm, maybe. Cause I was thinking about the four kids, but I didn't even realize that you both have a two-income household."
"They believed that when they brought in the white people, they would have fewer crimes and problems. They also expected to have people they could work with who would be obedient."
"Um, in girls' law, you have to write some words on the ground like the words are girls, foods, cigarettes, cars, meats, colors, and there's twelve of them. And when you get to each one, you bounce the ball and you say colors are pink, blue, red, orange, yellow, till you get to the end, you say out."
"Flintstones, when Pebbles grew up to be a lady and Bam Bam grew up to be a man, they got married. And so, Barney was the King."
"Yeah, but you know what the thing is, we were kind of, she tried to, there's been more than a couple of times where she would, um, you know, she would try to set us up for failure. Like, we had to work on her campaign, and we had to do a fundraiser in three days and raise two thousand dollars. And, which is like, you know, three days to do a fundraiser and raise two thousand dollars, that's pretty ridiculous. But we wound up raising three thousand."
"And she, if you do something wrong to her, she'll say, Get out of my face! Just like that."
"Yeah. Um. We can start off. Uh, I always have to ask. Do you consent to doing this interview?"
"there. So, it's kind of- it was just a really bad transition. And also, now that I'm going into my senior year, I don't have those programs like they do in DC where children can have scholarships. In Maryland, they don't really have that. So, that's why I stay in the Boys and Girls Club because I can get so many scholarships from them. At school, I haven't heard about a single scholarship in my junior year. And it's the same thing with college visits. When I was at [RD-SCHOOL-4], any college that came to visit, you just had to sign up. It didn't matter what grade you were in. But at [RD-SCHOOL-3],"
"And, um, it was a street, and I entered it, and I couldn't escape. And there were all these strange people looking. Oh, they looked terrible. They said, ""Miss, you little girl, you can't leave this place. Once you enter, you can't leave. "" And there was a used car building right there with a lot of cars. I thought I could go around there and exit, and I was crying and screaming and shouting."
"Um, tell me about your school. The school that you attended when you were little."
And the rules of the game also. I would like to expand on my answer.
"But I can't complain because I made the Dean's List and the Honor's List, so."
"They entered, they had this medication called methadone. Methadone was like a pill, we referred to it as a biscuit. It had four sections. So the methadone biscuit was what you received when you signed up for the program. You would go to the program, they would give you around a quarter of the biscuit, dissolve it in water, and stir it up. Then you would drink it and follow it with orange juice because it tasted really bad. Once you consumed it, it served as a substitute for heroin, just like it does today. Methadone is used as a substitute to help people overcome heroin dependency, but then they become dependent on methadone."
"Okay, that's quite enjoyable. Um, are there many children that you spend time with, like friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, or something like that?"
"Oh then, exactly. But if it was a team though, that's the thing. If it was individual, then I would have to-"
Ooh. You sound like a very intelligent young lady. That's good.
"And so, uh, well, you raise your hogs and then you"
They called to see what the water was going to do.
It sounds like you have a lot of work to do.
"Yeah, I sleep a lot during school. I'm always so tired."
"So did they have one of the teams leave, like, guards?"
"The day I brought your mother to my house, who did I inform that she wouldn't accept it?"
"And then one time we were on the Chesapeake Bay, I guess we were not too far out because, I guess about three or four hundred yards from the shore. And my cousin has just a small boat, and he is six foot four, and he weighs about two hundred and sixty pounds or something. And at the time, he only had one broken rod that he was using, and we were catching Spot at the time off of blood worms, and they were really biting well that day too. We were catching two at a time and we were only out there for about five minutes or something, and between the two of us, we caught about ten good-sized Spot. But I don't know. I think he got a little lazy or"
"Oh, they were very supportive. I mean, in fact when I moved, they wanted to keep him, but I took him with me. And then eventually, during the summer breaks, he would come down and visit. But just getting all the things in motion for like daycare, and when work- The one thing about it, when I went there I had my cousins, they were very supportive. I took a night job so that I could be home in the daytime, so I had him in the daytime. And then eventually I moved out, cause I stayed with them on base for a while. Then I moved to my own apartment. And, so there was some governmental plans where he could get daycare while I worked. And the things"
"Well, Dark Shadows is a picture of the past. You know, it's sort of like the past, you know. It's like a monster picture, you know? Scary, you know. And it's about Barnabas Collins and his uncle and things, you know. It's about a lot of witchcraft stuff, you know."
"But on a Monday, like on a Friday or Saturday, I would rather have the day off and visit my cousin or someone and spend the night with them and my friends."
"I really enjoyed riding that bike. I had a strong feeling that it would be the only bike I would ever own. I used to ride that bike to the Zippy Market, which is a convenience store in the countryside. There used to be a grocery store up there with several different names, but I can't remember the last one."
"No, anywhere except a tree or against a brick wall, just so he couldn't see where the other kids are running to hide. It might be behind a tree or, in those days, there were penny wagons around, you know. And you could hide behind a wagon or, and also there were quite a few vacant lots at that time. And of course, you could hide on the vacant lots behind trees and whatnot."
"When you reach a point where you have the advantage and can take advantage whenever you want, at will, you can make the moves you need to make."
"Too many. I can't even, I don't even remember them. I don't even. If my sister's kids right now walked up in this club, I wouldn't know them."
"Ks- And, um, the people in her family are always doing something to her husband, turning him into other things. [laughter]"
What do they call this part of town? I don't know anything about Washington.
"That was the Donahue Show, my sister was on his show with Marion Barry."
"Yeah, she wanted to showcase her physique. She never succeeded in the entertainment industry."
"Well, I don't have any favorites, but I like um, you know, Dark Shadows."
"Yes, So that was the end, right? , Did you find it amusing or?"
"Okay. Um, is there. Oh, the movie you saw. What was that one called?"
How many years did your dad go to school? What grade did he complete?
"Um, well the one I liked the best was my high school English teacher."
"*sigh* Well, exactly what? The size of it, or? The people in it, or?"
"And, um, which I turned out to be, you know, a pretty good cook."
"So, it's edited so that all the"
But what about seriously? Do you think-
"I enjoy getting dirty, like, I enjoy"
No. She- That's her- She tutors now.
"Yeah. So, you're talking about, like, gentrification."
"(Laugh) Yes, they're doing pretty well now."
"It's cool. It's alright, you know, s-"
"I mean, hey, I'm happy for them."
Okay. Tell me something about your school.
I'm just asking for the students. Okay.
It was good. We had a band.
That's great. You enjoy those adventure things.
"Oh no, my dad lives in Northeast."
And then RD-NAME-2 is like the mother.
"Yes, do you have any favorite shows?"
What do the adults do? Hmm? <laughter>
"Um, I think it could've been something."
You don't want. It calms you down.
If you know most of the. (inaudible)
I only had one at a time.
"She was really attractive, yeah. Yeah, I took college courses in high school. At E- at [RD-SCHOOL-2]. Yeah, I took college prep courses. College preparatory, you know. But I didn't go to college because I couldn't afford to. I had to get a job, yeah, you know. In fact, I was working when I was in high school, working. I got a little part-time job, from six to ten, vacuuming office buildings right downtown. Down there on K Street. You know, so this is back in the sixties, you know. Yeah. But I graduated from high school in sixty-six. And I got drafted in sixty-eight, you know (laugh"
"Oh, it's just something that I wanted to do, you know. And I guess other books and the money, for real for real. Just to call myself an author. Or just to, yeah, right there. Or just to call myself a writer. You know, just to have that title. Oh, and to see how much money I can make off of it. Just because I believe that the money is in the product, so if I have the product then I will have the money. Do you understand? You can't make any money without a product. So if I do these things, if I sit down and accomplish these things, then when it's time for me to move forward and find the right person to amplify my"
"The graduating class, you know, from RD-SCHOOL-2. But it was really, like I said, we all, many of us went to that high school from seventh to twelfth grade. And I believe when we got to ninth grade, there was a reorganization of the city schools, and RD-SCHOOL-2 was threatened to be closed down as a high school. But they ended up making Charlotte the middle school, and then we stayed the high school. So I had the same classmates pretty much from seventh through twelfth grade, and again, just really, I'm still in contact with several people from that time. And just, I have very fond memories about my high school experience. Very, it was a very special"
"Times are becoming difficult. And it's like, okay, I understand. If I look at my resume, I could find a new job. But realistically, the amount of money I earn, I need to call my friend right now and tell him no, no, no. Don't do it. Why? Because if you do, you're just fulfilling the stereotype that people expect from you. That's what they're waiting for you to do. Last year, I got arrested for the first time ever, and it wasn't even for something criminal. It turned out I had a lot of tickets on my driver's license, and they arrested me for that. I was like, this is crazy. They didn't really have to arrest me"
"He felt older, not younger, and he never appeared younger. We met there and we both quit."
"He forcefully took it from him. Then the car flipped, ejected him, and then rolled over him."

"We go to English, math, and science, and physical education."
"He was aware of it. Uh, so we tried to promote him, but I couldn't promote him, you see. So in the fifth month, he decided to retire. Well, this Captain, this Chief went to the promotion board, went up for Battalion Chief, and claimed that I'm the one who submitted a positive report on a man who was failing, you see. And so, yes, he did that. He tried to get me to stop being a Battalion Chief. But, uh, I finally got the promotion, although I faced a lot of difficulties in obtaining it."
"I, uh, well I'm a PBX operator, so um, I answer calls all day, assisting people in making calls to distant cities. I assist those in the government agencies that are on my switchboard. I assist those in making calls in their agency or to other agencies. I assist people calling from the outside. I try to help them to get the persons that they want to talk to in the different agencies. Occasionally I do some typing, little filing, but mostly it's the telephone operator."
"Yeah, I used to. I think by ninth grade, my GPA was 3. 8. And, like, I always. you know what I mean?"
"Well, it was about a poor girl who worked as a maid in a wealthy family, specifically, the family of coal miners. She fell deeply in love with the son of one of the coal miners. The story was really tragic because many people lost their lives in it."

"No, I mean, well, right now or when you turn thirteen. [throat clear]"
You have witnessed some of the negative effects of gentrification and similar situations.
"So, they're selfish. These kids, young people coming into the building are selfish."
"So, what are some of the different characteristics of your art, like dimensions?"
"Yeah. Cause you didn't stay with your grandparents when you were little, right?"
You probably could actually play outside on the street and things like that.
"And um, I like that because I can have a one-on-one interaction with the teacher. Not just being a number in class, you know? How am I going to get help from the teacher if there are four thousand or more students?"
"We were like, and we had other staff members there, but it was mainly my Chief of Staff, myself, and /RD-NAME-2/. Um, /RD-NAME-2/ was her special assistant. We were kind of like, we ran the office, and you know. And, um, it was a great experience. Like I said, it was very stressful a lot of the times."
"No, no. Maybe that was the version of the same game in other parts of the city or maybe other parts of the States, but no, we didn't play that one. No."
"That's unfortunate. Um, did you enjoy going to that place from seventh grade to twelfth grade?"
It's going to be someone's happiness. But it's not going to be what it is now.
"So we pretty much fall into the mentality where we have hatred towards the light-skinned brother, you know, hatred towards the black sister. Hatred towards someone who's less fortunate than ourselves or someone who seems to be more affluent than ourselves. So we let these things divide us and it causes us to, you know, it's like there's still hatred in us towards one another, where we have watched other ethnicities and groups of people strive together and grow together and bond together, you know, while we once were imploding or tearing each other apart. You know. So, we've taken our eyes off the prize."
"People often have distorted perceptions of tax dollars. The average person, including my brothers, sometimes holds conservative views on this matter. It surprises me because, as a black man, I would expect them to have a different perspective."

Do you think people are more aware of what kind of awareness there has been in terms of Princeville being the oldest black town in America? Has that always been part of what people know about it?
"Always. From ninth grade being so awkward and odd. And, pause 0. 16, You know, your body changing and growing. And, pause 0. 55, you know, pause 0. 30, the groups, the cliques. And, pause 0. 44, it is so odd now that I look at it thinking about the groups and the cliques. , pause 1. 28, Like in high school, pause 0. 11, it doesn't matter if your father was, pause 0. 72, not in your life. Or your father"
