why? cause you feed into statistic that's what they expect of you.
but i ain't studied very much about it. i know that-
"cause at the rental office, and my mother the vice president,"
"[he the president. ] he coulda just say that like, now."
[cause clearly there's something] going on with /rd-name-2/ and his birthday.
"and- but i really lost it, cause who would fix it?"
and don't tell nobody that you root for the opposite team.
"and i look at it now cause i work at /rd-work-2/,"

"like, friends, cause i was r- i was a only child."
"a part of the solution. not the problem, not the complainer."
"[mm], but that's- but you still talking about /rd-school-3/ high school."
[you] did? was there a lot of kids in the neighborhood?
i know y'all see me [/president/ out of this thing. ]

y'all endure like some pains that we won't even have
i don't know nothing about it. all i know is
"no, i told 'em, i'll whoop both of y'all asses."
somebody need to put obama on the twenty-five dollar bill.
it's easier cause i don't have to study i just
describe the college trip cause i haven't heard it /and/
and she turnt around and she threw urine on her.
do you know where your father or mother was born?
"you know, where you live at do you feel safe?"
[i don't see] how the fuck they could trip on
i would say from my opinion that's what we feel.
"hd don't care, they s- people smoke in the school."
and so she ain't like her son to do this.
why is he favorite teacher then? i don't understand. <laugh>
because it allowed me to find myself as a individual.
"by madison heights, so it would about- um, the dmv."
and then with it being a all male school and
[cause i] think you're just making up (laughing) stuff cause-
did you ever have a teacher you just couldn't stand?
"but yeah, i'm like it [went- and] it went"
i went around there when i was little so
"he- he live up simp, he knows my father."
just science cause i like doing hands on stuff.
that's when i start talking with him [again. ]
