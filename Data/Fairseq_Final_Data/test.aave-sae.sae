It was um yeah All of my um all of my black friends were telling me that I had to go So I went and I was like Im not enjoying myself But I dont like parties or crowds so I shouldnt have gone in the first place But it was just it was so um it was just really loud to me And it was hot I just wasnt having a good time
Man its really its basically it depends It varies its real My own personal art my own personal expression is normally abstract Its normally flowy Its normally layered because thats kind of like the influence of the music that I listen to Its kind of just how I am as a person Its like a piece of my imagination of sorts Like the way I view certain scenes the way I interpret music experiences so it always varies but its always kind of based around a flow of freedom kind of energetic type of thing Its a trippy type of thing Its like even with the meanings that are in it like the color and the rest

But then when I went to RD SCHOOL 3 everyone there wanted good for themselves wanted something different wanted something better So it was well it was an academic competition so to speak Im surrounded by people who want to work hard and do well instead of me just goofing off pretending to fight throwing paper and threatening the teacher like I used to do At RD SCHOOL 3 they didnt tolerate that kind of behavior You had to go through an interview write an essay and go through a lot of things
Then it came to my realization that they were down there you know on that street Youre just around the corner now you know
I dont recall having a lot of friends because I was an only child But the reason I remember going outside is because I used to play with my dog It was a little wiener dog Yeah that was enjoyable So for the most part my dog was like my best friend It was just me and the dog

it's like i want to do everything-it.
I believe gentrification has both positive and negative aspects The positive aspect is that it displaces individuals who cannot afford it while attracting new residents However we must not overlook the fact that those being displaced have nowhere else to go while the newcomers have the means to relocate Therefore there are advantages and disadvantages to gentrification It benefits homeowners but may not be favorable for those renting apartments Their rent could increase significantly if the apartment building is sold or bought by someone else The rent increase could range from a thousand dollars to five hundred or even two thousand Gentrification has its pros and cons Nevertheless it elevates the community to a higher socioeconomic level while excluding those who cannot afford it
Because you know different people from different areas bands are usually from different areas you understand what Im saying And you have a few bands that are from the same area but for example you have Northeast Groovers Those guys are really from Maryland you know what Im saying They are from Maryland If you go to a Groovers show you know what Im saying its like a straight party The atmosphere is very lively they really know how to get the crowd going The word crank means

I know people who can sing really well like nobody has ever heard before But when its time for them to sing in front of me they become shy They might think Oh maybe I dont sound good to you Because in DC there are a lot of people who always want to judge you regardless of who you are
Yeah And And it was even more amusing because our coach was the one teaching us So that was hilarious
it was like a real neighborhood. so kids sat with other kids from their mutual neighborhood.

Um well there are no Japanese or Chinese people in our group We only have African Americans and Caucasians and thats all
I mean yeah because I dont really think he enjoys discussing his upbringing Because he was poor And then his mother passed away when he was in his twenties and he and his brother have a strained relationship I suppose he simply appreciates his current life For him he has achieved success because he never thought he would be doing the things he does and living where we currently reside Um so I believe he prefers his life now compared to how it used to be
Uh um so Im going to talk about going to RD SCHOOL 3 in a moment but lets go back to the swim team because I told you I was going to come back to it mm hm
positive things that come out of that.

I used to hang out in DC when I was about sixteen years old Even though I was from Maryland it was considered cool to spend time there It was right on the District line and hanging out in DC was seen as cool The kids from DC were seen as cooler They could stay out later dressed differently and had more freedom compared to us Hanging out in DC was the popular thing to do but it was very dangerous in the 90s So its a blessing that Im still here and able to talk about it because many of my friends are not
Yes Okay What about are there different names for different marbles or something
Nah I understand that Definitely definitely So who do you think is going to become a millionaire first among the three of you
Like say if I just came from fighting Come down here if I tell him he would be like he will talk to you he wont yell at you but hell talk to you about it like he will show you that its not good to fight but if it comes down to it if you had to protect yourself its different but now like I got in an altercation a couple days ago and he was like thats not cause people dont fight with their hands anymore Like people either you gonna get shot or you gonna get stabbed Like thats why I respect him and its that dont matter what youve been through you can feel at home And I would say you might not

I was around thirteen or fourteen seventh eighth and ninth grade We started a band called Young Influence Band I used to be the singer in that band I went from being the drummer to rapping and singing at the same time They decided to move me to the second microphone There are different microphones in a band You have the lead microphone person who introduces everyone and holds the show together Then you have the person who sings the songs maybe even a girl who sings songs Then you have the second microphone which is for the person who raps There are also other people in the band who have different roles Its a band so everyone has their position But lets stay focused

Going out and purchasing the latest Gucci Prada Fendi and Hermes items that will not bring you happiness It may bring temporary happiness but it wont truly make you happy both externally and internally It wont No Instead be true to yourself and then go out and make a positive impact on the world Thats what brings me happiness being able to selflessly give to those who are in genuine need I would do it
Um being the middle child it was quite enjoyable I was the thinnest among my brothers so I received all their hand me downs Even my younger brother was bigger than me So it was fun to receive clothes from him and I didnt need anyone to buy me clothes because I could fit into everyone elses But thats not entirely true They did buy me clothes but I still received a lot of hand me downs It was a cool experience Um my older brother is three years older than me so we had a bit of a gap We didnt really play together as much as my younger brother who is only one year younger than me So

you know I had to complete the full five years Then they introduced this retroactive ruling My five years were already finished on May 5th 1945 However they implemented this ruling on July 12th Thats when they made a big mistake because I had already completed the five years before they adopted this ruling So I took legal action and filed a lawsuit in the District Court It was expensive but it was a matter of principle you know

That way my child can become who he is meant to be and not who he is influenced by me his mother or anyone else Its important to not unconsciously push him to become someone hes not Sometimes we as parents may not realize the impact of our actions because in our minds we believe we are doing whats best
We do not manufacture anything as a group of people You know We are consumers we use a lot of things but we are not encouraging our children to become engineers scientists you know Physicists you know we are not encouraging our race of people to strive to be better than they are
I mean of course its just hearing it is crazy but its not really too surprising because once I really started seeing like what the drugs like the amount of drugs that they were sending people away for which was a small amount like point five is giving people ten and twenty years in jail Thats not a lot on the street Thats not a lot at all so just seeing that I had already seen that they wasnt playing no games with the black community They were pressing down Its like if this is what you gonna do these are the years youre facing And its like for them to push it in the neighborhood its like almost like its crazy
Um well I didnt appreciate the fact that they demolished my street I was really affected by it and I had to work at RD SCHOOL 4 and I was angry every day for a period of time Im like you know I used to live right under this school You know and my neighborhood was very important to me It wasnt flawless but it was our own

What advice did you give her to protect herself because its a serious matter
Man well coming from the perspective of my white friends because you know my white friends I love them Like theyre honest like were close like brothers theyre always real with me you know what I mean Probably they might think that some white people believe that we would rob rape or murder them Its like I could be walking down the street and there could be five white guys walking towards me theyre much bigger than me They walk past me and apologize acting scared but theres five of them and theyre much bigger than me So they ask where our aggression and anger come from Its frustrating when someone is scared of you you know what
i think that's great.  side job. i will not judge.
I mean this really isnt a tradition maybe the Sunday dinners or just having the family stick together Thats about the best tradition I can think of Cause no matter what the family went through or the kids know each other we know who our cousins are we know who our aunts are When its time for a function when its time for parties or functions we all can get together Its you know with no problem You know some people got drama in the family and they cant go to this place they dont wanna go to this place because of such and such They might not like their aunt or they might not like their cousin See we have
I dont know man Im a realistic rapper Its about realism you know It could I think I think my music is deep And I think I talk about sensitive topics and things that people are not comfortable with saying out loud But at the same time I feel like I rap with motivation Its not like glorifying Its like it is what it is But you could always progress yourself You know what I mean thats my style Cause like Im all over the place Im not gonna categorize myself to one single thing You know what I mean Im an artist like It could be some club stuff some party stuff
Ill see you I mean I saw that guy before Nobody is going to bother you there I mean if Im around Im going to get involved too
I enjoy Ritas and Four Lokos However I havent actually gone out to a bar and consumed alcohol I dont engage in partying going to clubs or doing much of that So for the most part I prefer going home with a small Rita Thats probably my best option
Her name was Miss And she was nice If you were nice to her and did good work and went home to study instead of going outside she would make good grades for you And my aunt lets see when I say she made good grades for you See I had an aunt and she was eleven years old Shes twelve now Her name is And she was a Negro She had to go into a it was no more room in the fifth grade rooms for her She had to go in this class with all white children she was the only one And all the white kids none of them could stand her not
Yeah so they never wanted to impose religion on us So I have never attended church services with my parents I always went with friends They said if I wanted to go I should go with friends And Im thankful for that because I think it led all of us to find God on our own All four of us believe in God and it was never forced upon us My little brother goes to church with his friends and I went to church with my friends But all of that coming together made me really curious about where science comes from and learning about that When I went to high school I think literature was my main interest The school I attended RD SCHOOL 3 High School offered more
Okay cool Dont worry about me I would like you to be more open and provide me with detailed answers if thats alright

Um I am the executive administrative assistant to the regional vice presidents RD NAME 1 and RD NAME 1 Um I love my job I like that Im making a difference even if its from the background and not necessarily right out front and directly interacting with the children because what I do is very important in terms of grants that we receive and how our board members fundraise for us So its a very important job its highly stressful Um I love my coworkers I think my work environment makes me work harder Because Im not just working hard by myself I can look to my left or my right and see a person working equally as hard if not harder Um
And when we finished eighth grade at the we would go to the high school which was on Street But now its on and

"because if i was scared, then there was no point in me going outside. "
We never had the opportunity to experience being cousins Like oh Im going to my cousins house to spend the night and my mom was really strict about us spending the night at other peoples houses She didnt allow it Not at all I have never spent the night at anyones house Im seventeen I have never been to a sleepover
