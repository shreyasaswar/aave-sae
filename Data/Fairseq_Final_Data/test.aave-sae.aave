It feels like it doesnt affect me personally but in my pocket book because things are more expensive so ts I feel like thats how it affects me Um its also like I like and maybe this is like the t I dont know if this is the typical gentrification conversation but I like what I like to see some of the changes that I see in DC I like seeing new businesses I like that I feel if I go out theres so many new restaurants bars whatever that I can choose to you know cause its so much new coming into DC But its sad I mean you grow like okay so growing up for me I thought all cities were like DC So I thought it would be I thought other cities were mostly black I thought other cities were mostly black professionals And not to say that doesnt exist other places but I always thought it was in it was t highly cult uh concentrated like it is here and then the older I get and the more I travel and kind of pay attention as much as Im capable of paying attention to things outside of myself um ts Im like oh its not like this everywhere DC is a little unique Its very unique so its bittersweet in the fact that unfortunately as the city changes its bringing in a lot of stuff thats good but its I its its its sad to think about i if it continues at this rate if all the black people move out thats obviously sad that we wont be here at all if things continue So I would say that part is sad And youre just its just its its a unique experience now that Im older and Im an adult and I understand it its a unique experience to walk around a neighborhood and you see a bunch of black people who are like I dont say black people dont do well but just so many uh families that have been there for generations or you know Even if they havent been there for generations like professional its just to think of that culture leaving the city is sad
Mm laugh okay three Uh my number one all time favorite is when I joined the leaders program with RD NAME 5 Uh when he started his leadership program in two thousand thirteen that was the first program I started doing at the Boys and Girls Club and it has helped mold me into the person that I am today with all the leadership qualities that I have And just being able to perfect my public speaking skill as well Thats my first memory My second memory is mm going being able to ha being the oppor given the opportunity to travel to New York That was a great one as well for the uh think that was our second yeah that was our second Our Lives Matter teen campaign movement that was our first one out of state though And it was a great experience cause I never been to New York Excuse me I never been to New York but like being able to go out there for the first time it was great It was different scenery I didnt know it was gonna be so cold up there So I didnt bring like a big enough jacket all I brought was a sweat jacket Bad move on my part but made it work laugh And my third favorite memory is the Birmingham trip that we just had recently Cause whenever we get whenever I get the opportunity to s travel out of state Im gonna take that opportunity And just being able to go to Birmingham which was Ive been pretty much all on the East Coast but that was a whole nother time zone for me which was just a great experience in all

We moved to DC in two thousand thirteen So from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen I moved from Forestville and I was living in Upper Marlboro briefly um cause I didnt wanna be anywhere near DC You know I was kind of like if if youre familiar with the story of um uh Jonah in the Bible He really hated the Ninevites I cant stand this city I hate Nineveh And you know DC when I was growing up um was you know Chocolate City It was the murder capital of the world Choppa City And my mom worked in DC Public Schools so we would ride in DC and I would duck in the back of the car I would duck in the back of the car cause I didnt wanna get shot Thats how scared I was of DC So I didnt wanna live th I didnt wanna live anywhere near DC We moved to Upper Marlboro briefly but in Upper Marlboro from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen God started really moving on my heart to give me a burden for the city that I didnt wanna be in And my heart got softened toward it to come and help and be a part of the solution And so after much prayer fasting consideration We some praying fasting people Uh my wife and I uh felt led by God to move from Upper Marlboro into DC and thats when I resigned from my position as the youth minister at RD WORK 3 in two thousand thirteen because God wanted me to come to DC and uh start RD WORK 5 um here in RD WORK 5 I didnt know it would be in RD WORK 5 back then but I knew that God wanted me to be out of Maryland and in I wanted to he wanted me to live where I lead And so we do live here in the community um about three minutes from um RD WORK 5 where we worship So thats how we got to DC We came in twenty thirteen Uh we were able to move here and God miraculously worked it out We were able to sell our home and move here and start doing ministry and ever since then we just been kind of seeing Gods Grace Um people coming into the church You know were able to help people physically and spiritually We help feed people give people clothing We help people with their bills Uh of course we share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with them Weve seen peoples lives change People have gotten saved People have that were on drugs people that were selling drugs people that were in criminal activity theyre now you know tryna live their lives for Jesus We have some people that have re entered into society recently who come to the church and then we have some very affluent people that come to this church So were just a big hybrid of um social economic goodness laugh from different stages and areas of the DC Metropolitan area And everybody gathers in the gym in RD WORK 5 And the one thing we have in common is that we love God and we we have a love for each other Even though we may have different skin tones we may have different bank account state uh statuses we may live in d different size houses we all have the same God and so RD WORK 5 is the vision that God gave me when he when I felt him leading me to leave RD WORK 3 and come to DC clears throat And w weve been worshipping at RD WORK 5 um in RD WORK 5 since June twenty fourteen so about a year and half now

was tr sh Im Im I think something dramastically happened in Jefferson Street with my father So my mother wanted to move from that area
to get out of town So those are the things that the family kept from me And ts so I often wonder how did they meet up here Cause I worked at the library at the RD WORK 6 And this kid used to come in there all the time and he was really really out of it It was psychiatric so you know he had some problems So he would come in and hed always leave me a message by the title of a book Hed have messages titled like I cant even think of any now But the titles if you put em all together it was a message So it was kind of scary I was very nervous but I didnt let him know that And I didnt run from him or anything like that So one day he was um he was reading in the library and um he used to read the Whos Who So he said RD NAME 1 come here So I went over and he said this is my dad or father whatever he said I said oh RD ADDRESS 4 Georgia I said thats where Im from He said really I said yeah I said I knew some RD NAME 3 I said you must uh be the RD NAME 3 from RD ADDRESS 4 I said you know RD NAME 4 He said it was my grandfather I said really And he said yeah I said oh I knew them I knew your family and like that So the very next day well actually his father it was a professor at the U of R He was he was a professor of economics at the U of R But hed never visit RD NAME 1 beca his name was RD NAME 2 but everybody called him RD NAME 1 the son So f RD NAME 1 would go up to the U of R Every time he get a honor card that he could leave the grounds hed go to the U of R And hed smash all the windows in his fathers car or hed spray paint em but security wouldnt and the father wouldnt press charges So they would bring him back to the RD WORK 6 Hed lose his privilege then when he earned the honor card hed go and do the same thing His father would visit him but he stopped because RD NAME 1 would become violent on the ward he was staying on So he stopped visiting him but his mother would visit him And he got along pretty good with his mother but he did have a temper But he never displayed the temper with me So the day after he was reading the Whos Who and his father was in it and you know Id say I know the f the RD NAME 3 The very next day his father came who n had stopped visiting years before He came and h his wife came with him He introduced hisself told me where he was from And I shook his hand and I was glad to meet him H well uh I think we chatted a little bit and soon after that he would call and or his wife would call and they would invite me out for lunch And it was to thank me for being nice to their son So wed always go to uh Phillips European You ever go

I think gentrification has its good and has its bad The good is kicking the people out that cant afford it while youre bringing people in But also lets not forget the people thats being kicked out they didnt have nowhere to go And lets forget about the people thats coming in they have money so they can go wherever So it has its pros and it has its cons Its good for people that have houses And it may not be good for people thats renting an apartment Or that may um or the apartment may or the apartment building may be sold or or bought by another person and now their rent is increasing by a thousand dollars five hundred two thousand It has its pros and cons However it brings up your community to a upper scale while it takes some people out that cant afford it

"that's what it was. i even  time i was getting my taxes done and this guy,"
I wanna say I wanna say when I was in fifth grade I r um we had a little speech and I talked Its on YouTube And it was about Abraham Lincoln And I went up there with my suit and I said da da da da da da And then once I heard the applause I was I was out blown because as me I was like really shy I didnt wanna go up there first of all I didnt wanna talk My mom and dad they was like you should youll youll blow it out the park And all of my friends they had bigger lines than me and my little four sentence on a flip card that I had to study They came up to me while they had like paragraphs and I had like a four sentences And they said I think you did a good job you did very well That was a big moment for me Cause after that I spoke in front of hundreds of people
"i mean, not even counting all the little hood fights that happened "
Community pool I thought it was a rec center because nah it wasnt no rec center it was just a pool Cause they didnt have nothing like um games or anything like that you just come there to swim And thats it
Up like sixteen and Because it was cool to hang out in DC even though I was from Maryland and know like right there on the District line hanging out in DC was cool DC kids were cooler Um they they could stay out later they dressed different They had you know more freedom than we did And so hanging out in DC was like the thing to do but it was just so dangerous in the nineties So it is a blessing that I am still here and able to to talk about it because a lot of my friends are not
Uh huh Very good How about uh what are the different are their different names for different marbles or what

that way th you know what Im saying my kid can be who hes meant to be and not who hes who like me and his mom or whoever is forcing him like you know what Im saying like subconsciously kind of forcing him into this person We may not know what we doing you know just like parents they theyre ignorant of what they do to you because in they in they mind they doing whats best
We dont we dont we dont we we dont we dont manufacture anything as as a group of people You know Were u we were consumers were using a lot of things but were not uh encouraging our children to become engineers scientists you know Uh you know physicists you know were not encouraging our group race of people to be to strive to be better than they are
I mean of course its its just hearing it is crazy but its its not really too surprising because once I really started seeing like what the drugs like the amount of drugs that they were sending people away for which was a small amount like point five is giving people ten and twenty years in jail Thats not a lot of thats not a lot on the street That thats not a lot at all so just seeing that I had already seen that they wasnt playing no games with the black community They was pressing down Its like if this is what you gonna do these the years you facing And its like for them to push it in the neighborhood its like almost like its crazy Its like its like you going into a trap Its like wha what is its like somebody holding cheese out in front of a mouse Its like what you gonna do Like they playing with you Its you know Thats how I really feel Like they playing with you And they know your situations is not the best and puss plass plus the past influences of other successful drug dealers you know thats gonna play a part too So its its all its its crazy I I really do I Its crazy Its like being put in a box
Um well I didnt like that they tore my street down Like I really was traumatized and I had to work at RD SCHOOL 4 and I was mad every day for a while Im like you know I used to live up under this doggone school You know and my h my my neighborhood was so precious It wasnt perfect but it was ours you

So hell be like oh yeah like Ill go wherever you guys wanna go And then when we tell him hes like no I dont really wanna do that
What do you feel like is a piece of advice you gave her like kind of um to protect yourself like cause its its real
exhale Man well well coming from like my white friends point of view cause you know my white homies I love em Like theyre honest like we brothers like they gonna keep it real with me like they gonna you know what I mean like laugh Probably like see you know like I dont know I dont wanna say it that bad but its like some of these white people they really think were like r we would like really like rob them and like rape them and like murder them You know what I mean its like I could be walking down the street yo it could be like five white dudes walking down the street these motherfuckers big as hell Walk past me they wanna split their way and apologize oh so sorry were like bro stop acting so scared bro its like five of you guys and yall ten times bigger than me You kn like you know like so they aks where our aggression and anger come from You be mad that somebodys scared of you you know what I mean So I feel like th thats a big perception like they think th I think they think every black person like a drug dealer or like a killer automatically like you know what I mean cause oh your skin is black And I got dreads like that just put it on for me with the stereotype like And I wear like gold teeth so I know And I do that on purpose just to like push the culture more and more just to be like you know what I mean like we here like that shirt is like my gold teeth you know what I mean
i'm not mad.  side hustles. i'm not 
I mean this really aint a tradition maybe maybe the Sunday dinners you know what Im saying or something Or just just sticking just having the family stick together Thats about the best tradition I can think of Cause no matter what the family went through Or the the k t the kids know each other we know who our cousins are we know who our aunts are you know what Im saying When its time for a function when its time for parties or functions we all can get together you know what Im saying Its you know with no problem You know some people got drama in the family and they they cant go this place they dont wanna go this place cause such and such They might not like they aunt or they might not like they cousin See we have that but but what family dont But for the majority part we all can really get together have a good time At the drop of a dime all we gotta do is mention something is going down and something is about to happen and then everybody on social media everybody is like this is going down at such and such house be there or be square
exhale Um I dont know man Im a realist rapper Like its realism you know It could I think I think my music is I I think the way I rap is deep And I think I talk about touchy topics and things that people are not comfortable with saying out loud But at the same time I feel like I rap with like a motivation through it Its not like like glorifying Its like it is what it is But you could always p like progress yourself You know what I mean thats my style Cause like Im all over the place Im not gonna categorize myself to one single thing You know what I mean Im a artist like It could be some club stuff some party stuff some love stuff some hate stuff anger stuff You know what I mean like Im a human like I Ima be everything For a artist to be like one thing is just like kind of like faking the funk you know what I mean Its like this is what sells for me so Ima just do this I do whatever I I I I feel Like I could feel like this today write this way or write that way and Ima put it out this way and I dont care who like it or not Its about Im expressing myself to the world you know
Ill see you I say I seen that fella before Aint nobody gonna bother you there I mean not if I if Im around Im gonna get in there too
I like Ritas I like Four Lokos But I havent actually gone out and go to a bar and drink I dont party Like I dont party I dont really go to clubs I dont really do much of that So for the most part Im good with going home with some with some little Rita Its probably my best bet
Her name was Miss And her name was Miss RD NAME 1 And she was nice and and and if you be nice to her and do good work and go home and study instead of going outside running outside m you know she would she would she would make good grades for you And my aunt ts Lets see when I say she make good grades for you See I had a aunt and she was eleven years old Shes twelve now Her name is RD NAME 4 And um she ha she was a Negro and she had to go into a and s it was no more room In um fifth grade rooms ts um for her And she and so ts she had to go in this um class with all white children she was the only one And so all the white kids they all of em not a one in there could stand her not a one cause she was a Negro And and she never did nothing to nobody She was always You know she was a nice girl
Yeah so they never wanted to force religion upon us So I literally to this day have never walked foot in a church to attend church services with my parents as a whole Um I always went with friends They said you know if you wanna go go with friends And Im thankful for that because I think it led all of us to finding God by ourselves All four of us believe in God And never once was it was it forced upon us My little brother Goes to church with his friends I went to church with my friends Um but all of that coming together made me really Well let me find out where science is coming from and about that Um when I went to high school Hm What was it Id say at that point in time I think literature was my big thing Um and I think because the school I was at uh when we went to RD SCHOOL 3 High School they offered more AP classes in literature
Okay cool cool dont mind me I will want you to kind of open up and give me some long winded type answers
Because um the water kind of it kind of got high over here but it wasnt to the point where we had to be evacuated

am the executive as the executive administrative assistant to the regional vice presidents RD NAME 1 and RD NAME 1 Um I love my job I like that Im making a difference even if its from the background and not necessarily right out front and directly interacting with the children because what I do is very important in terms of um grants that we receive and and how our board members um fundraise for us So its a very important job its highly stressful Um I love my coworkers I think my work environment makes me work harder Because Im not just working hard by myself I can look to my left or my right and see a person working equally as hard if not harder Um and it it gives you a reason to get up in the morning because its like youre not doing it alone And if you ever are in a position where youre drowning the organization that I work for we help each other I mean and its like we help each other until we get it right Its not like okay Im just gonna show you this and then Im going back over to do my thing No Im gonna stay there with you until we figure it out together And thats been very different for me Ive never worked in an environment where people cared so much about one another just as much as they do about the mission so Its a its a great a great work environment like I said Our mission is outstanding I believe in what we do Of course there are some changes um that I would like to see but who wouldnt anywhere But I think that one thing that I can say is that we do identify problems that we have and we try to collectively come up with a solution from from all levels And its not just the leadership that are saying hey this is what youre gonna do Like I feel that we do have an input in what goes on here And thats just been very different than any other work experience that Ive had so
And when we finished eighth grade at the RD SCHOOL 2 wed go to the high school which was on RD ADDRESS 4 Street But now its on RD ADDRESS 1 and RD ADDRESS 2

Mm hm Where there any special names for any of the marbles Like is there a a name that you call your favorite shooter or anything like that
i feel y'all. i'm from the neighborhood too. he was a guy from the neighborhood 
But I think also because I love the classroom too And I think And I told you this before I think my joy of learning came from you Like you were the Who did I see in my life that was a teacher
And in the middle of Baruch its actually um a shelter called The Castle they call it And um That was a big part of childhood too because my mom was like dont go over there to the shelter kids th The Castle kids The Castle Cause then they were like very ostracized but It turned out I m I wound up marrying a Castle Kid
But like I said I would write that letter Let everybody know I exist and tha theres nothing for me
Yeah they when they opened it thats how they was doing it So he end up going that was the only per like when I s like that was the only person I knew there So
when she came to classroom and me and this girl were playing with uh this girls toy And uh and my teacher hollered at us Miss RD NAME 2 hollered at us and um and told us uh stop playing Cause she had a reading group
white couple coming down the street with a uh just married sign on the back of their uh orange and uh white Chevrolet They uh stopped at a corner down the street where a lady named RD NAME 2 lived with her dad and she was sweeping the front and they asked her for uh she could they could get some water to drink and her dad came out and asked what w what did they want she told him uh dad they said they want some water you know They just got married and they uh they want some water before you know before they go on their way So he said well wait right here Ill get you some water And he went in the house and when he came back out he had a bucket he had a he had a pale of water and he dumped it on em and soaked em with the water and said like get the hell off my property you know So that was my first experience with you know racial racial tension you know seeing that happen when I was four years old And then I was r I remember when I was about uh six uh I was in like the first grade went on a field trip We went on a field trip no it was second Im sorry Uh when I was uh when I was seven second grade we went on a field trip and I remember um the little little class of white kids and we were a class of black kids and there wa a little little boy in the uh white class looked over and said said to his teacher he says look Miss Miss Johnson or whatever her name was A whole class of niggers You know And she didnt say anything you know She didnt say watch your mouth or anything it was just like you know come on guys lets go lets go over here Well but really that to me was like he just called us a whole class of niggers you know and thats that was another experience with racism so We knew that uh that there was racial racial tension in in America You know we knew that blacks had for so long been uh what do you call it rele uh uh in other words looked upon as like less than human We knew that um we we we were the struggle And we knew that uh despite the struggle we were a strong people You know and uh James Brown w uh in the sixties when he made records like Say it Loud Im Black and Im Proud Those are the things that really fueled us and gave us you know uh the incentive and the initiative to like have pride in ourselves
Now give me an example Like use it Lets have a conversation where that where you would have to say that What would I have to say to
When Im at home I go home a lot I go home Ive gone home every weekend Especially this year And um Im on the board for the Black Student Alliance
kind of what do you wanna work in now? like if you can get into-
um in our in our job there are there were three hundred I think our cap is three eighteen full time and tenure track professors And there are at this present moment I think we counted eighteen black folks And like four or five on they way out And so theres like nine at Brighton nine at Daemen the downtown campus And so that that lack of of of visibility and I I Im very uh vocal and Im very very present in in black related stuff and so for me the challenge is that intersection of my blackness and my womanness And as a woman I dont feel um I feel like Im a black woman Thats a particular thing So that impacts the way that you know I my students I remember walking into a course one time and you know uh my students like you the teacher I was like yeah So she was so older black woman Shes like youve been speaking to me all time and I didnt and then she said can I call my friend And I was like yeah Cause class hadnt started She called her friend She said can you tell her I was like hi Im her And you know they started laughing and Im and then just seeing like my mothers friends and my uncles friends who are like fifty something sixty years old and they know my my mother struggles and my uncle struggles and they like and Im like oh there go my uncle such and such And Ive never really met these people but they feel like they can do it because I offer myself bare to them Im like you know this is the the journey Ive taken So the challenge is is that people have different expectations for me and sometimes I have those for myself and knowing how to l you know lay boundaries out but also being able to be heard and be visible and not be invisibilized um yeah
Its very simple They wanna capitalize on it As as should they Because after all its a market S business so
my iTunes I like TI I dont listen to him everyday though I listen to this guy named Black

and um yeah So I always ask whether or not you perceive or have been told by someone else that you have a Rochesterian accent
one of my songs is made up my mind.
"can't really link up how you used to, but that don't mean we not close."
I felt I felt like people had my back I felt like GOLES was Froze was my gang I did
But I actually had to go through a reading program that first year of being in DC um Virginia Uh second grade Uh full year I had to meet with a reading teacher every single day because I wasnt reading at a second grade reading level
I said dont you do that I said you stay over here with us and just see you know how its gonna be
And we have to suffer because they ha must have some place to live cause they wanna live on the Lower East Side and theyre willing to pay anything to do so
like that's why i respect him because it's a lot of people
Oh yes definitely so definitely so People they maybe are they arent changing fast enough for the number of people that we have on our hands I mean and uh for instance like uh you see we have so many uh people um both Negroes and whites who are migrating from the south Mostly Negroes because of theyre chased from the farms and because there theres no food for em to eat and out of the S S States and of course there are in the States uh there are still a lot of prejudices in the States not only in the South in the North too you see And they and uh its taking its toll its showing itself now Especially with the uh I was reading the paper this morning about where the white people are moving to the suburbs you see And what they creating a se segregated city city pattern you see Which theres no st there are no steps being taken to correct these things as they come up But the Look Magazine had this uh has an article in it and uh its an interesting article on s suburbia and uh and they have a seem they seem to have a theyre trying to solve the Yes its the the title of it is Scarsdale Sc sc the scene is laid in Scarsdale New York and uh and its in title uh New Role for Suburban Schools And uh they think that if they can get the people to keep to keep cool and remain where they are stop st to stop keep running because a Negro moves in into the neighborhood Uh they could
ts And I would um help my friends that need and do not have And I would give to those who not have overseas
Ever since I was a little child al it always was a conflict Somebody stealing money and but um the way you deal with that is you take it as a grain of salt and go on
"this is something else. like, about this salad dressing. she talking about she gonna charge me"
he was t he was an old police officer in the area And he was like yeah this neighborhood was bad Thats why I do this now And he was bragging about how the the cops would get called and they would wait for three cop cars to come to respond before they would get out the car do anything There had to be three on site And how none of them ever wanted to get there Of course Now Ive watched people die Ive watched people die in the street cause no cops came Ive watched that s thats my reality Its happened twice in my life

Oh man Um craziest experience So exhale um I I once did a wedding Mm gosh And I wrote about this on my blog because it was very very disturbing I once did a wedding where the caterer was an absolute diva And matter of fact Ive done a couple weddings where the caterer has been a diva but in this particular case the the caterer was like really really upsetting Um its pretty standard or at least normal in my mind and I dont uh I b I dont Im only the wedding planner here that the caterer they usually have a team of people that um set up the tables and chairs you know get stuff ready for You know just at least set the tables and chairs up And maybe they dont wanna put the linen on it maybe a decorator drops the linen and the centerpiece They come back and put the place settings stuff like that Work as a team If not the caterer then maybe the rental company whoever dropped off the tables and chairs but nine times out of ten its the caterer its always been the caterer So on the day of this womans wedding the caterer was there after we had already had issues about where she was gonna set up because the bride had changed venues And so the venue went from a indoor venue to a outdoor venue She had opportunity to come see the venue b beforehand but waited til the week of the wedding to come see the space the new space Um decided that you know the way that it was set up she wasnt gonna be able to do her job as expected because the kitchen was too far from the tent ts So she wanted the bride to pay for another tent so that she could have her own tent to be set up in Again this is something thats in my mind why dont you have your own tent Youre the business person not her why you making her pay for a tent But regardless she the bride paid for a tent so that the caterer could be closer to the to the actual tent that the reception was in So on the day of the wedding there she is in her little tent shes getting it all set up Tables in the the tables are broken down on the floor on the ground Im like oh you know are you and your guys gonna get these set up Shes like oh no Im not doing that if I do it its gonna be another hun two hundred and fifty dollars At this point its this brides wedding day Youre not gonna come to me with any additional cost that you want me to take to her because that is gonna piss her the fudge off And my job as a wedding planner is to keep her stress free Shes supposed to be blissfully blind the entire day so that even if stuff does go wrong she dont know about it She just thinks everythings going according to plan That is my job as a planner So no Im not about to go to her f for this two hundred and fifty dollar up charge that you wanna charge on the day of her wedding That was one thing You know even after the tent thing I had to

And its its still to this point in time And I think like I said its cause when I was younger we never talked about image in my home Like of course my father tells me Im beautiful every day but never realizing that I have pretty eyes It wasnt until I moved to Virginia that it was a constant In the course of a week two three people oh you have beautiful eyes What are you mixed with What are you And its like do we really live in a society where we have to do that Its Everythings about race Everythings about skin color Everythings about eye color Everythings about hair Um next incident is when uh vacationing in North Carolina cause thats where we typically go to vacation Um there of course theres racist people everywhere So having those conversations where my older brother who is darker in skin tone gets dirty looks more so than I do Cause I guess they assume that Im partially mixed with white so they accept me more than they would accept him And thats still a issue that we have with my brother now Like he feels like hes the black sheep of the family cause hes darker Like he is your about your complexion
So I think over time I just I with m with me becoming comfortable in who I am I just had to be comfortable with people being who they are and being comfortable that they gonna have opinions about me And I cant necessarily change what theyre saying And the I had to I had to learn that from my mom cause I remember one day my sister said something to me and I like broke out in tears And my mom was like you better get some back back bone because the world not gonna be that nice to you
