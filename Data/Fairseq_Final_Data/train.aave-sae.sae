No not until the entire area has undergone complete transformation Because if you notice they have made changes by constructing new condominiums in this area but there are still ongoing issues and challenges just up the street from here So where do you think the people who have lost their jobs will turn to for survival Its within walking distance So no I believe it would actually create more problems because its like placing temptation right in front of those who are struggling Its like having candy right on the counter for children Its literally just around the corner This situation reminds me of when my mom moved to Fort Washington Potomac It was an upscale neighborhood and you wouldnt even realize where she lived because
I told myself that I need to find a balance so Im going to improve when I go back in two weeks Currently Im just feeling okay This week is my time to relax
mm-hm. i was not able to make it to the last reunion we had.
Many individuals were unaware of the concept of gentrification They lacked knowledge about their own lack of awareness regarding its impact on their lives
I learned how to drive a manual transmission because both of my parents drive manual cars The car my parents were going to give me is also a manual So that was the first challenge learning how to drive it Its funny because I actually took the driving test before and failed and that was in a manual car

Well sometimes there is a circle and there are some people in the center The objective is to try to get the people out If they catch the ball they are not out They then return to the circle if they do get out The last person remaining is the winner I suppose
And you didnt have to worry about being chosen based on how you look Thats messed up
Okay so alright Did your parents grow up in DC Can you tell me about your parents
Yeah You know go go music had to grow on me because growing up as a kid I remember being in RD SCHOOL 2 Elementary School and hearing Doing da butt You know Spike Lees School Days and I was like thats great So you know that was impressive But EU thats you know shout out to them But it was just good to really experience a unique sound from our city And then as I got older go go music started not being so original It was just taking hip hop or rap music and just repeating chants repeating chants repeating chants repeating chants Repeat this rap hook Repeat this rap hook I
This summer Ive been seeing people just dropping like flies dying left and right I worry about getting locked up for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or hanging out with the wrong people Thats why I come down here to get away from everything I have people down here who I can talk to Thats really what my program is about providing a safe space for those who dont feel safe at home or have something going on that they dont want to talk about So they have someone to talk to Yeah
So Im a little hesitant to say this but I consider myself a film enthusiast so this is difficult I dont know I actually dislike that question a lot its my least favorite question Um because I genuinely dont I mean
I write plays and um I have also worked on a few movies but peoples reliability is inconsistent and I struggle with editing which can be discouraging
Well Ive been attending the same elementary school and that was also the school I graduated from in eighth grade The name of the school is RD SCHOOL 13 located in Southeast DC I started going there because of my friend who was on the football team with me His mom introduced that school to my dad and that was pretty much how I ended up there That school has played a role in shaping me into a more formal person and it has also brought out my more respectful side if anything
that he tells them what to do and they do it?
Well they have to refer to it as a hobby because I enjoy tinkering with them Ive always had a fondness for steam engines Youre aware that this is something that has stuck with me since I was a young child You know the fire department used to utilize steam engines to pump water
So she told me that she put a curse on Barnabas and said he would never die but have eternal life However he sleeps during the day But the Doctor cured him of that in 1968 and they created a man named Adam using other peoples arms and legs
Im not going to share a sad story and make you feel sorry for me but Im going to explain what I did The point is because your mother and father are alive right now you could argue that even though Ive been gone for a long time I could have visited or sent a postcard But theyre ready to leave town when they see me
Did something happen that triggered you or were you simply not interested in doing it
Jean She wanted to be a movie star She kept working on her appearance and everything but she never achieved her goal She didnt make it even though she looked decent
So it groomed me to know the foundation Most of the people out here that shoot music videos or work on film they all come from a film world They never really got the foundation of theater you know Those kids dont take that theater class or that theater lit class They rather take the CGI class you know what I mean the production class So it was cool that I took those classes because the way I got into RD SCHOOL 5 um its crazy but I did a poem Now this is how illiterate I was to theater So Im like yo I wanna audition for this but I dont know what theater is So RD NAME 1

As an adult I enjoy dining at The Oceanaire when someone else is paying Um and I really like Mortons Steakhouse and Ruth Chris The Oceanaire and Bens Chili Bowl are also favorites of mine Oh theres also Horse and Dickie which is a famous fish spot that used to have a long line just for their fish sandwiches because they were that good at one point We have popular little hole in the wall spots in the city as well as some nice four or five star restaurants It really depends on my mood and what I want But I know that I can go to a mom and pop restaurant in DC and get some great food similar to New York with its variety
He was exposed to a lot of gunfire He was fully aware of everything that was happening He witnessed people fighting on a daily basis He even witnessed people getting stabbed all within a span of three days He experienced a lot of what I go through in just three days So
Well I attended a Catholic school and of course all Catholic schools have religion They have catechism three times a week which consists of questions and answers about who made you who is God the Ten Commandments and various practices of the Roman Catholic faith Then twice a week they had Bible History which was different from catechism as it focused on straight history However the catechism itself which outlined how to act in certain situations was in the form of questions and answers Now in addition to religion we also had reading spelling and arithmetic drills The Catholic schools always emphasized memorization of the multiplication tables as well as addition subtraction and division We had to
Yeah Yeah so she came from New Jersey She felt compelled to enter a period of fasting and prayer which is essentially seeking Gods guidance for our lives During this time you refrain from eating and focus on prayer She felt that God was calling her to move to Maryland It was surprising because she didnt have any family there Her family from New Jersey was confused and asked why she was going to Maryland However she moved to Maryland because I was there Thats why she came So she came to Maryland and visited the church where I worked She started volunteering in the youth ministry which is where we met We both had a shared desire to help young people live better lives ultimately for Jesus Christ
Oh thats great Youre really skilled at storytelling Um do you own a pet
Well there were uh well there were several a couple of them there who were studying French
Please tell me about a few occasions when we were spending time together and you needed to use your gas can
I think that I preferred Broadcast because it was more enjoyable I believe this is because I have a strong attention to detail and I enjoy writing So it naturally led me to be interested in script writing filming and working behind the camera I enjoyed all those aspects of it
How about the group of guys you hang out with do any of them speak languages other than English

Years ago it should be noted that there was a girl who gained attention in the media She had twenty two children This girl happened to be my sister I distinctly remember when she appeared on The Donahue Show and Marion Barry asked her why she had so many kids Her response was that she believed it was her purpose as a woman to bear children Additionally her daughter KK was also present on the show and was pregnant at the time Sadly her baby had passed away while still inside her womb resulting in a stillbirth That was her experience Yes my sister is the one who had over twenty children
And this um what would happen if I were to move to DC if I have never been to DC before in my life
Yeah I suppose its difficult to explain it properly Im more skilled at demonstrating it to you
I also lived on campus The main campus is located in Garden City New York
"like the street is quiet, but other times, i do not know what is happening. "
He was aware of it Uh so we tried to promote him but I couldnt promote him you see So in the fifth month he decided to retire Well this Captain this Chief went to the promotion board went up for Battalion Chief and claimed that Im the one who submitted a positive report on a man who was failing you see And so yes he did that He tried to get me to stop being a Battalion Chief But uh I finally got the promotion although I faced a lot of difficulties in obtaining it
Man it varies Cause you know you know what Im saying it depends bro Some guys get intimidated You cant walk around there feeling intimidated like
"well at/rd-school-/, i was familiar with some of the kids at the school."
I want to ask you a few small things about your house What do you refer to as the main room
Uh I work as a case manager And I work in a residential facility which is um youth that are sent there are are there because the judge has mandated them to come to our program And our program will usually last from six to nine months Its uh these youth that have that are there have committed crimes From battery to carjacking to uh petty theft Uh grand larceny Just you name it they have done it Um and so thats the population that Im working with now Not only that most of them have some kind of well actually most of them um have low IQ scores as well
So you didnt go anywhere else and you attended college in DC Pause for 014 seconds Which high school did you attend or which school did you go to
But thats what Im working towards and so Im trying to achieve it Like that was my twenty fifth birthday that year it was my goal to get my own place be independent So I was like okay
And so anyway she said um Im not going to allow you to have my child held back And so the principal was familiar with my grandmother because it was an old school You know RD SCHOOL 3 Thats an old school My grandmother attended it
What is your opinion So you have okay so all of you gather and have a conversation Where does your grandmother reside
I continued to be stubborn thinking I was doing something positive I had one that was damaged but I wasnt aware of it I threw it and ended up cutting my thumb open
After he removed his beard Erik Van Zipper returned and the finger injured him Thats what they referred to it as the finger
I kind of kept to myself and didnt participate in any extracurricular activities in school I didnt want to do it even when I was younger and expressed an interest in tap dancing My mom would take me to tap dance class but when I realized she couldnt stay with me I would cry and then just go home So Ive just never been interested in anything Im really attached to my mom
People and things of that nature You know it was not the same Going to school you knew you had to go I think it took me around thirty minutes
Everyone was familiar with our family in various locations So we were present in many places I didnt really involve myself in the rivalry between Simple City and Eastgate I couldnt But I spend time in both areas frequently
Um pause for 043 seconds take turns pause for 015 seconds Jacks you go out Its ten Jacks throw them out and you pick all of them up pause for 052 seconds Then you throw them all you pick twos up until you get to ten pause for 090 seconds And then pause for 045 seconds the game is over
Last year on my birthday I believe I received a well sort of received on my twenty first birthday I was unable to go out because I had recently given birth to my baby
And it was just crazy um when they started providing us with information on where to go for assistance
Yeah probably about a month later When I began to really know people like when I started to get to know people on a deeper level Thats when I started noticing people on the bus and the train
the last person with their feet in the circle is it.
"understand, everybody is in a closed box. i- it's no-"
oh well then a lot was happening at the party. <laugh?
No because the school I attend is very diverse So you have black people Latinos Mexicans Ethiopian people African people and Dominican people There are different people from different races The diversity is very good in my school and I appreciate it However my school hasnt changed It has remained the same since the beginning
It is Ive been in my position for about eleven years On the fifth of July will be my anniversary so thatll be eleven years And over the eleven years the population of the kids that were seeing is changing And its changing with the trends You have more kids now that are involved in gang activity And so it becomes more difficult to work with those kids because not only are you trying to pull them in a different direction but theyre being pulled by another group So it becomes difficult for them to make that choice of what they want to do And most of them my feeling is most of them will return back to where they left when they came into the program So the
Growing up my basketball team was the Lakers However basketball wasnt really my sport so I was raised to be a fan of the Redskins
Yeah are you wearing your clothes in our store and putting in your code Its funny because I still hear those stories today from the same company because people are still there So yeah
and you could be anywhere else but you decided to come and talk to us. this really changed my perspective.
Yeah Yeah And right now Im just going through a thing There My truck broke down The engine went out on my truck I bought a car I went to the auction and bought a car And the cars acting up so I need to get rid of it Ill get rid of this car and try to get another truck The car is running but since it was used it probably wont pass inspection I dont want to spend too much money on it Anyway thats just the experience Yup I dont cry about it I get up every day and when I walk the dog or go on my walks I pick up cans Im into
Yeah I have encountered a single individual who is content It is clear that you are associated with this person I would like to discuss a topic that we briefly mentioned earlier I was curious about your experiences after the flood Specifically I would like to know about the various locations you visited subsequent to leaving your house
I dont want to be a teacher Maybe I enjoy disciplining children and if I were to discipline them its likely that their mother would get involved
And I thought to myself you know what Im going to take the summer off and just relax So in the end I ended up joining a non profit organization I was just doing some part time work there And I
Well you know people are still going to perceive minorities in a certain way This perspective comes from my experience working in the restaurant industry There is always doubt about my abilities even when there is someone right next to me who is consistently making mistakes Eventually that persons mistakes reach a point where they have to work with me and then I succeed I shouldnt always have to face that doubt or constantly deal with these situations This isnt me playing the race card its something we have witnessed firsthand Ive seen this happen at the hospital as well I dont really have personal experience with that as I havent been through any of it So I know that there is a greater diversity of professionalism outside
dc and how the world has evolved.
And you know you can learn a lot with science Essentially everything you do it all adds up with some science
And then you know we would say dish and terms which we used And then we would use one two threes beating or
Yeah I remember all of that Good stuff man We used to walk around the neighborhood and intimidate people bro
"they would say, what? because no one- when you hear math, you do not see a black woman's face."
Okay How do you play football Do you play with a group of kids in the neighborhood or do you have an organized team or something
He had many friends and then as he grew older he began spending time with a group of older guys who were the ones that initiated it
It demonstrates that not all young black men should resort to street life as their initial solution or their first attempt Essentially it is a mentoring program You would participate in the mentoring program from ages six to eighteen and then from eighteen to twenty five you have the opportunity to become a mentor
See And Times are tough you cant just you know displace people on a wholesale And these developments are significant
i was not- i used to work at goldman sachs. this established
I frequently return to that place My friends what they did was they demolished the neighborhood and then reconstructed it Many former residents moved back So one of my friends who happens to be my best friend was one of the people who returned Therefore I used to visit that place frequently Well at least I used to visit it often in the past
let us see. i will make it so we can talk more about atlanta.
Now theres this music theyre playing now you all call it rock and roll whatever it is You only have a few words about eight bars The whole song is eight bars When I was performing our songs it was different You had to get that melody There wasnt any nonsense like it is now All you get is shouting AH oo WA you know
 traveled all over the place. you can understand why he would be relaxing.
So high school is very different from the real world Its like a completely different environment or a separate world altogether
Okay So until you were eleven you lived in the Princeville area
Well actually yeah We have some members who left here and went over there to become paid firefighters
"you know, i'm going to-  going to stop telling people to have a nice day."
In Clay Terrace Um could you please share some information about your childhood Are you the only child
I have seen millions of pictures of people at carnival but I have never personally seen a guy in some type of costume
Well man I started actually living in Atlanta specifically Decatur on the east side of Atlanta This was around 2015 I came here in November 2015 man And you know it was just like obviously Atlanta is the land of opportunity so coming from where I come from which is Rockdale county also known as Trapdale you know everybody is kind of in this closed box Its not
I believe that if my mother and father were actually married I would become extremely frustrated or stressed to the point where I would metaphorically pull out all of my hair
I understand what youre saying They started playing at the Brandywine Firehouse which I thought was a bit far for a go go but I was okay with it
Mm Yeah but we had someone here and he was helping his friends So I thought to myself well thats that guy
You know I understand that there will be some things that you will have an issue with you know because I have seen some of the things they are currently doing
They were they were that when they were saying what is mumbo sauce that is one of peoples favorite memories and moments in DC when they order takeout You dont even have to tell them It comes with it when you order takeout The mumbo sauce comes in the bag You dont even have to say mumbo sauce If you say wings mumbo sauce is in the bag
I mean come on we live in a completely different era now You can see the kind of wealth that exists in our society
Yes Ive had teachers who were pretty strict They were pretty strict on the kids I had a sister who was one of the Catholic sisters and she was very strict And of course there were some rough children in the room too you see They had to be strict sometimes But they maintained order Most of them maintained order in the schools
I was like Oh yeah Being there now I mean anywhere But back then he was kind of like how you would be you know just an ordinary person coming up Trying to figure out what happened The ideas he had then with people getting together now today But he had a good idea mixing people of different races together
I have always believed in myself always believed in God and always believed that Gods power will guide and support me This belief comes from my mother who had faith so I have modeled myself after her A funny thing about me is that my mother named me after a white lady in the hospital who told her to give me that name My mother questioned why she should name me that and the lady said it was because I would be fortunate and able to do things others cant and find things others cant find Believe it or not when I worked at the Patent Office in 1983 there were files missing for many years I worked in the warehouse and would find those missing files every day My brother
Yeah I understand it All those things and such I just sometimes need time alone You should see me when I go to the bathroom I really feel it You might think Im crazy in there because I hum to myself And if I hear a song on the radio thats from back in the day you know I dont want to hear it
Yeah So its it was it was the experience but it wasnt a good experience But uh but I sleep well at night you know I sleep well at night I didnt kill any babies or anything Or shoot any women you know But it was the experience And I dont wake up with sweats or anything So I dont have any uh that Post Traumatic Syndrome you know No PTS I dont suffer from anything like that Cause I just try to live my life right and dont worry about anybody else Now dont try to correct definitely dont try to correct anybody else If I see somebody doing something wrong I
no. i think people will get interested. you have a good following.
"oh, can i sit with you? because it is so noisy in here."
So the girlfriend jumped in it I jumped in So Im like you got it messed up youre not about to hit him they dont have anything to do with you you need to mind your business And she got smart So I hit her and I started fighting her Then jumped in and tried to hit me So hit dropped I hit the girl she dropped And we walked off And I was talking to I was like do you know I just really fought for you
And people dont attend these meetings people dont go and voice their concerns people dont say hey I live here and I require this
if youre from here then youre not from here I know youre not So its like a dead giveaway And I get people from all over the place like Alaska Utah Nebraska Miami New York I had one guy from LA in my car hes like hes like um he was like man I hated it there I love it here I was like really Like man Im trying to go to LA Hes like nah youre not gonna like it I was like okay You know its just crazy cause people are from all over and theyre coming here And so now with the whole process of gentr
He omitted many details He said something about getting off the bus both him and her He didnt mention the age difference but he knew she was attractive and that he intended to marry her
Yeah they are demolishing all of the public housing projects They are constructing new houses Its interesting to see people of different races living on streets that you never thought you would see them on Additionally people from DC are being displaced and moving to Maryland so thats another aspect of the situation
Um Wes Moore and Wes Moore were two individuals who are not related they simply share the same name They both have the first name Wes and the last name Moore One of the Wes Moores had many opportunities and achievements despite not having a father figure in his life due to his dads passing On the other hand the other Wes Moore ended up incarcerated as he engaged in criminal activities
Yes I believe that people have worked effectively I also have some pictures of when we took them during the foundation construction phase
It wasnt specifically a youth group We would simply go out in the community and engage with young people in the community
Yeah because hell be released this year Well hell be released He didnt get more than six or seven months
and that's when it rolls over first base. i know that does not mean anything. you have to kick it over.
My boyfriend is no longer my partner I am not bothered I am not concerned about him I have distanced myself from him And all of his friends
"we are so close. i have one cousin, i have one friend-"
"um, i liked the face that i didn't have to take gym, because they made us take dance."
Thats what Im saying its just that DC is desperate DC offers a lot of money to grocery stores to open up Thats why they finally allowed Walmart in DC Why do you think they let Walmart in DC Theyre doing things to attract people to the city Theyre drawing people here like a magnet And its going to be like that for a while because theyve figured out what works Oh these young millennials they like that DC is a city but still has an urban feel Its like suburban they can still walk go home ride their bikes to work and go out and have a good time while feeling safe They love it They love it Theyve figured it
It really is a mixture of both Its bittersweet But its more sweet than it is bitter You know its actually fun You always have somebody to hang out with you always have everybody in the same age group You have someone who has your back when youre being picked on and messed with You have a sister who will fight the girl whos bothering you You cant physically harm her so get your sister to beat her up You know you know you have an older brother you know you have an older brother who
I really disliked science They discuss the human body and I often confuse the different parts of the body Mm
Because I feel like it sends a message out there that maybe having sexual relations with someone on this planet will result in receiving the same in return Or at least having the potential to receive the same Just because you havent encountered anyone who reciprocated it in the past doesnt mean you cant reciprocate it with someone else
Im scared of them man Im more scared of them than I am of you What
Sydney Poitier was a teacher and there were white girls and white boys in his room It seems like they didnt like him initially Also there was another boy who used to bring pictures and stuff to school Whenever Sydney Poitier called him to do something he would have pictures of girls in his lap
Pretty much Ive always lived around there Except for there was there were like two years when I lived in a disadvantaged neighborhood but

Um right now I am currently attending school online to obtain my associates degree I have been going back to school for approximately three years now Its just that being a working adult and also being married although not yet divorced and having a business it was just too overwhelming for me to juggle all of that and focus on school Um one thing that Boys and Girls Club taught me is that we are surpassing the work but I just wanted to mention that
that is why these buil- that is how these building became decrepit
Um and like we should value our lives and be grateful for the people who tell us that we wouldnt have achieved this level of success We should appreciate the struggle because it adds value to our personal narrative making it more meaningful So lets show gratitude

Because I am here Not just sitting here but everything comes back to this place Even the memories The people the places Oh you asked me about the neighbors And I mentioned Ms Sister earlier Ms Sister used to call my grandmother grandmother Why I dont know For me not my sister she would ask me to come over and go to the grocery store for her And she always wanted some sizzling bacon When I got to the door she was naked What am I supposed to do What am I supposed to say I just acted like I didnt see it Yes maam Do you want some sizzling bacon I

Um I used to be married before so I was really focused on taking care of the household for a long time and I just I dont go out as often as I did in the past But I do know that Adams Morgan was very well liked for various go go bands And they perform all over in different parts of the city and in Maryland so its just a matter of visiting their website and looking into it But I believe we should give it a try

But DC and Baltimore are approximately forty five minutes to an hour away from each other I dont understand why they have a conflict
Yeah thats really my main goal but I was just thinking that maybe writing a book would be easier than writing a movie script So and then I thought about how many movies are based on books If I were to write a book first
And um there were a lot of things happening and Marine Boy and his father along with a crew were underwater They had to go to a certain place to meet a captain and the ship And um the crew had to do something There was another crew that had to shoot some things out in order to find their way back And uh they had to go through a tight tunnel and they had to blast their way through using missiles or something And um they successfully got through And then there was this monster controlled by a mean man and his crew And um the monster started chasing them It was like a long snake about a hundred or a thousand feet long
Okay So you grew up there when you were young You lived in a house right behind where Bridgers store was on Bell Street

Its normal it seems normal You dont really realize the conditions youre in because youre just so happy Because my parents did a really good job they were together married the entire time til my father passed away which was twenty something years into their marriage So that was very rare to see like my dad is black and Dominican and Italian my mom is Jewish and African American You dont see that a lot in this community so That was a rare part So I had that and then just a happy childhood so if there were any struggles we never knew Im the youngest of four So we never knew So I had a lot of fun I didnt realize
